I鈥檝e been thinking about self-harm even though I鈥檝e always found it ridiculous, and my mental breakdowns have been occurring more and more often. I鈥檓 more prone to crying out of nowhere or at the slightest mention of something even remotely upsetting to me. I鈥檝e been in two relationships and both of them were terrible, one partner forcing me into sexual activities, and one partner leaving me for someone else while blaming me for the relationship failing. My mom has been switching between being nice to me, ridiculing me, and ignoring me. It makes my already low self-esteem drop even more, and at this point, I鈥檝e learned to ignore her, but It鈥檚 still difficult sometimes to tone out her words. My teacher at school doesn鈥檛 teach the material but expects us to know how to do it on his level even though we鈥檙e beginners (AP Language). He gives everyone bad grades all the time and never praises us when we do good. His lectures to the class are no better than saying we all are terrible students and should be receiving even lower grades. He makes me feel unwanted and going to his class makes me really anxious. I鈥檓 currently trying to drop it, but my principal won鈥檛 return my emails regarding it. I want to get help, but the other part of me feels like I don鈥檛 deserve it. I鈥檝e been surprising myself when it comes to controlling the urges to harm myself or worse, but the urges have been getting more tempting as of late. I haven鈥檛 really been feeling any positive emotions lately, but whenever other people are around I subconsciously smile, even when I don鈥檛 want to. I hate the way I am now, and I want to get better, but I also don鈥檛 want to cause anyone trouble."
