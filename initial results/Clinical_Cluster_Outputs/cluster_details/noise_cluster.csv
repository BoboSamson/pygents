Years ago he had some sort of breakdown and moved in with my parents and stayed for 4 yrs. I found some odd things on his computers. He was on some sort of online site with animals portrayed as humans. A curvy woman鈥檚 body with a sexy fox female face. I also found a small lion cub (Simba) stuffed animal with a small circular hole under the tail that was hot glued around the circle so that one could see the stuffing inside. I am guessing he was using it as a sex toy. I told my mother she asked me to call the psychiatrist he was seeing. I did he told me to get him out of the house immediately. I told my mother and she had him leave. He was laid off 2.5 yrs ago I found evidence of the same sort of behavior.

I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment鈥搕o mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don鈥檛 know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don鈥檛 worry she pulled out).

(I don鈥檛 know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord鈥檚 county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn鈥檛 find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she 鈥渃ouldn鈥檛鈥 make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because 鈥渟omeone鈥 had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls.

She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver鈥檚 seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system.

"My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost a year. I know that he is the man that I am going to spend my life with and I have no doubts about that.

His mom has a multitude of health issues and is in her 50s she hasn鈥檛 worked in over 20 years. His dad is 46 and stopped working after hurting his knee at work when my boyfriend was 18. Since then my boyfriend has been supporting them completely. My boyfriend is a caring and loving man and his parents take advantage of him. They are not appreciative and always expect him to provide them with whatever they want鈥攈is dad in particular. At first when I moved in things were okay but recently it has been very hard. His parents both smoke in the house and no matter how many times we talk to them about it, it continues. They are constantly in our business and wanting us to run and get them things. Recently his dad came into a decent amount of money and with that money he was supposed to buy a vehicle, he did not. Instead his dad takes my car almost everyday and is gone until it鈥檚 time for me to go to work which just leaves me sitting at home. I want so badly to move out and have our own place just me and my boyfriend. But we cannot afford to pay for our own place and a place for his parents.

We are only 25 and it feels like we are never going to have the chance to have our own family.

"For the last couple of years, since my mom and step-dad married, he has been treating my siblings and me badly. I鈥檓 the oldest, being 16, and I have a younger sister who is 12,and a younger brother who is only a little over a year old. My step-dad gets up in my face quite often yelling and screaming. Other family members and my friends have witnessed it. No one in my family likes him except for my mother, (who seems to have a thing for abusive men. She divorced my father to reconcile with the man that punched her in the stomach and put a loaded revolver to her head while she was pregnant with me). My step-dad has come at me several times, asking if I wanted a piece of him and getting a little too close for comfort.

"From the U.S.: Hello. I was molested by a relative of our neighbor when I was 5, but I鈥檓 not sure if what my grandmother did also counts as molestation. She would joke around with me and touch me between my legs and I would always laugh because she convinced me that this was all in good fun. I was around the ages of 4 or 5. She never did this around my mother, though. Only when we were alone on the bed. Does this count as molestation? My therapist thinks it does, but I鈥檓 not sure. Maybe I am in denial? I鈥檓 23 right now and thinking about all of this is making me a wreck and making me see my grandmother in a different light (I still live with her and my mother, by the way).
