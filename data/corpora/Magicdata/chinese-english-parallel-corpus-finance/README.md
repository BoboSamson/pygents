Hi, I need to use your

NLP-CEPARACFIN: A CHINESE-ENGLISH PARALLEL CORPUS IN FINANCE

The page
https://magichub.com/datasets/chinese-english-parallel-corpus-finance/
says "This work is licensed under a Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License."

However, when I download the file, README.txt says
"Copyright of this dataset belongs to Beijing Magic Data Technology Co.,
Ltd. All rights reserved. Unless otherwise specified, the data are for
your personal and non-commercial use. No part of the data may be
distributed or reproduced in any form or any means without permission
from the copyright holder."

Question - what are the terms for using this file - can I refer to
"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0
International License" terms or can you give me the "permission" to use
share publicly?

Here are the kind of works where I am referring to it:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11443
https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02427

But I want to refer it more and be able to share it according to
"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0
International License" terms.

Is that possible?
