 So I’ve been dating on and off this guy for almost 3 years He is 3 years younger than me During our relationship we had always had issues First he wouldn’t call me he would prefer to go out with his friends than me he wouldn’t even remember the day of our anniversary or things like that we kind of tried to work all that out but I’ve always felt that he really doesn’t love and care about me even though he says he loves me Also he has lied to me during this time first once he went to a party and when I asked him if he did he lied to me in my face What bothered me was the fact that he had pictures dancing almost rubbing himself with another girl He lied in my face when I asked! After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah he would make me trust him again Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again lie to me in my face looking at my eyes After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn’t have coverage there that’s why he didn’t take it…(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him…I think he doesn’t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls…we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance…we had sex once after the breakup I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex…I still have feelings for him that’s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good… What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times…why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me? I Feel that I can get someone better someone that would make me happy and don’t hurt me that much…but I don’t know why I keep going back with him,No Distortion

Hello I have been friend with a guy since grade 6th We were in the same grade and best pals of each other Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me But when I proposed the GUY he refused me and said he never felt so And everybody including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too have taken his feelings for me wrongly He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me He certainly stopped talking to me No contacts at all for 8 months But I still loved him n I still do I was always concerned about him So kept a detail about him through his brother and friends but he fought with them too At a point of time he broke all his ties with everyone and entered a new life,No Distortion

My boyfriend is diagnosed as bipolar schizophrenia borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorders He has recently in the past year quit taking medications for it He has tried a number of medications and none of them have worked We have been doing research recently about the symptoms he has been having We have found that the closest thing to his symptoms that we have found is he has been having Hypnagogic Hallucinations He wakes up in the middle of the night freaking out He is terrified to go to sleep He stays up for a couple days sometimes because he is so afraid to sleep Could this be a sleeping disorder? Or could it have something to do with the mental illnesses that he has been diagnosed with?

I’ve been dating this guy for 2 years When he is “on” it is great We are able to talk about any subject and have lots of fun and what appears to be a deep connection – we talk about serious subjects philosophies growth the meaning of life etc It’s very engaging This goes on for a few months and then suddenly he turns “off” One day I wake up and we are not connecting at the “normal” pace (ie daily phone calls a few texts or plans for in person contact) The connection feels severed there is an edge in his voice and he is cold I notice this give it some space (2-3 days) and then intentionally and gently bring it up Initially he is defensive but pretty quickly he will acknowledge that yes he’s withdrawn and eventually some narrative will show up as a reason for the behavior – he felt I disrespected him (I was late returning a call) he felt I abandoned him (I had some trips and so I was out of town) he was nervous that I’d reject some of his behavior that he’d been hiding (he smokes occasionally) etc The conversations come back on line and we talk about his feelings needs and better ways to communicate etc He does have a therapist and I suggest he work on these issues with his therapist Then everything goes back to normal until it cycles again,No Distortion
My brother is a paranoid schizophrenic with bipolar disorder autism and adhd His schizophrenia comes with homicidal thoughts He’s been admitted into a hospital before and was being treated for years About a year ago now he went off of his meds and it’s been downhill from there He’s currently in a manic state and has been for months He refuses to get back on his medications and it’s taking a toll on him and everyone else He’s violent combative and just dangerous Anyone he sees in his way is a target He has harmed my mother’s dog Tried to hurt my toddler (he is no longer around her anymore at all) He’s choked my mom stolen her car loosened the lugnuts on her tire and when she went to drive away her tire fell off He’s assaulted a police officer threatened multiple times to kill people It hasn’t gotten to the point where even my mom had to move out We’ve called the crisis line the police even adult protective services and no one will do anything about it He’s going to seriously hurt someone or himself and I can’t bear the thought of standing back and watching him drown He’s destroyed his apartment and belongings We are at a loss for what to do We can’t force him to get back on his medications because he is still his power of attorney We can’t force him to seek treatment at all Is there anything we can do?

My brother’s always been a shy child but he had a good relationship with family and friends In his teenage years he started to withdraw I was the only one to whom he kept talking He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents aunts cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him Now at 19 (almost 20) it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody not even to me and not even with monosyllables He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago) If I try to talk to him he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom He is very childish too in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away) He prefers their company to that of people I don’t even know if he has friends He certainly avoids his college peers He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too) He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college Otherwise you’ll find him home Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism even? Maybe Aspergers Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism though he would have some speech difficulties wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly Never shown any speech delay either Besides I think I read someone is born autistic so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18 It’s been an evolution that’s why I’m not sure what is going on Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition?

Recently I have been consumed by certain fantasies and lack of empathy When I see people in the street I wonder what it would be like to kill them(mostly out of boredom) and I have thought of ways I would do it – I’m particularly intrigued by poison or psychologically engineering a suicide because it’s quite passive(not violent/bloody) However I don’t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone to be honest I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it I’m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends However while I feel like I can switch my empathy ‘off’ (stop caring) I do care very deeply for some people and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better So I don’t understand why I can be a caring person as well as regularly lack empathy / feel superficially charming and manipulative and have fantasies are urges to hurt people? I’ve taken the Hare psychopathy checklist and scored 29 but like I said I can feel empathy when I want to so I’m not sure that’s really accurate Please let me know what you think and any advice (I know this isn’t clinical advice and I don’t think I need professional help its not THAT bad) But still appreciate any thoughts (From England),No Distortion

From a young man in the US: I wanted to understand the link between the upbringing of one  past experiences and past ideologies and how much it can affect ones current reasoning Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past In other words  a person who grew up in a religion  and changes his religion can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully,No Distortion

I have Borderline Personality Disorder & Bipolar Disorder Type II with transient psychotic episodes I was prescribed a brand new anti-psychotic Invega (3 mgs) about two & a half weeks ago for: distorted thinking amplified emotions & daily crying spells As opposed to the same class of more recent anti-psychotics such as Seroquel I am tolerating this one very well — with the exception of weight gain I have been dieting & exercising in an effort to eliminate or decrease this side effect but have still already gained 5 pounds! I’d like to know if this side effect will subside as my body gets acclimated to it or with time I discontinued the others because this is the one side effect which I will not withstand I discontinued the others due to this reason If the answer is no then should I try the older anti-psychotics such a Haldol?

I have been was in a relationship with a man for three years I will call him A We lived together and he wanted to and still wants to marry me While I started and developed the relationship with him because I was very lonely at the time I developed feelings for him and to this date he is my closest friend The problem that I always had when I was with him was that I was never in love with him Staying in the relationship felt very emotionally safe and I was happy being with him even though I never felt the “butterflies in the stomach” being with or thinking of him He felt like a family and I did and still do care about him And that was what I was looking for – the emotional comfort of having someone next to me who loves me and cares about me The missing part in our relationship was the fact that I never felt romantically about him and so two years later I started sleeping with another man B which developed into a relationship I feel in love with B but I have been comparing him with A and this of course has made me see more of his negatives I am very attracted to him and like to spend time with him However when the time came to “go home” ie do every day things relax and stay home I would always want to meet with A A continues to feel like home like the place where I go at the end of the day to be comfortable share my day at work watch TV or just relax while being silent,No Distortion

I have been with my boyfriend for a over a year now He had always gone above and beyond for me We do have an age difference where he is 4 years younger than me But he has always been very mature and well-spoken for someone his age Recently we have been experiencing a lot of downfalls in our relationship He has a very busy schedule and doesn’t make a lot of time for me We are also long distance he lives across the country I’ve been asking for some time to video chat and discuss over some of our issues and he agrees that we should do that as well but he has not prioritized time for me I’m feeling very insecure in our relationship because lately when we fight he doesn’t seem to care One minute he is expressing how important I am to him and that he loves me And then the next he is getting defensive and said that I’m not being considerate and understanding During our 6th month together we had a big fight which led to me breaking up with him because I was frustrated with him He ended up getting drunk that night and told me he kissed one of his female friends It took me awhile to forgive him and to move past it but I feel like the feeling of betrayal never really left He told me he would never do something like that to me again and that it was something stupid that he regrets so much But I feel like anytime he gets upset with me or we have an argument and he goes out with his friends I fear he would hurt me again I don’t know what to do He isn’t giving me much to work with because I can’t seem to be able to get him to sit down long enough to talk If he isn’t going to class or studying he’s working And that’s almost 7 days out of his schedule packed What do I do?

I do have my handful of disorders in disarray but that’s not what I’m here for just a general question that popped in my head OCD is a very real condition that people do suffer from but there are the non-suffers who claim to be under the influence of OCD who just get the satisfaction of an &”OCD-fix” (ie seeing a ball fall into a hole that seems like the hole was designed for said ball) Does this mean that every human has some type of OCD that is a more of toned-down version for the people who have it classed under the mental condition or is it some type of satisfaction that our brain produces chemicals for like dopamine?,No Distortion

When I was young maybe 7 or 8 I was watching Blue Hawaii and there is this scene where Elvis takes this girl over his knee and spanks her because she tried to kill herself by driving into the lake…when I say girl I guess I really mean young woman Anyways ever since I saw that scene I was really intrigued and curious I had never seen a man spank a full grown woman The only thing I could relate spanking to was the abuse that I witnessed my mother perpetrate in my home But this scene didn’t seem like what my mom did So anyways after that every time the topic of spanking was broached I got this feeling of anticipation…like just hearing or reading the word made me excited for lack of a better word When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship I became engrossed to say the least I read all the DD stories And decided that I couldn’t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one… Also another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 yearsI was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs… but the real issue I guess is…is this a healthy expression? Is there something wrong with my desire to be disciplined by my mate?,No Distortion

I personally don’t think my hallucinations can be considered as a symptom of Schizophrenia because they have decreased in both quantity and vividness over these two years after taking medication currently I’m not taking anything and it’s rare for me to hallucinate now only while feeling an extremely negative emotion or panicking and even then I wouldn’t call it a psychotic episode 2 years ago it was more of shadows taking on silhouettes of humans but still a little bit blurry and a disturbing amount of violent voices in my head (which I didn’t recognize at all) but nowadays if it ever happens I just see couple of colorful animals or shapeless blobs of color and I only hear what I heard throughout the several days with the voices from people I have heard it from but not forming any sort of pattern or making sense,No Distortion
My wife (age 39) has past history of depression followed by several months’ therapy long time back Lately once every year for the past 3 years for about a period of 2-4 months each year she has been showing some severe behavioral responses to stressful situations For normal people these may not seem stressful situations usually like house hunting work load at college arguments among couples etc But often when the stress remains for several days especially with doing something new she starts showing various reactions like sadness complete change in personality from a jovial one to a quiet depressive one with a constant facial expression showing emotional hurt withdrawal from normal activities complete loss of sexual drive aversion of eye contact responding in frustrated way to normal questions irregular sleep or lack of sleep irregular eating schedules complete lack of compassion Taking one example she started studying with a seemingly normal mood She was unable to find a word for her work which made her extremely frustrated Even my inability to help with that word was met by seeming skepticism as if I wasn’t actually trying to help After 3 hours she got up with a sad expression complete silence averting eye contact and saying good night in a frustrated dejected way and retiring for the day On normal days she is a very loving person but she is not a threat to anybody even during the bad days However her reactions were more severe 3 years ago with tendencies to cry all day sitting in the dark corner of a room shivering inability to talk facial spasms These don’t happen often and is never visible to anybody outside home But there is always an underlying chance that any severe condition or normal arguments may trigger her reactions Somehow such stressful situations arose exactly once each of these 3 years and hence that many reaction phases However she is smart and completely aware of everything and hence not willing to see a professional My question: What exactly is it that can be going on with her?Is there a name for this?Are there materials that I can read and show her to persuade her to take help? Is there really a treatment? Is it actually a disorder or something else? Please help This affects daily life and normal relationships at home (From the USA),No Distortion

Q Are hallucinations in any way a projection of either the unconscious or the subconscious mind?

… personally Identifiable Medical & Detailed Financial Info Being Legally Exploited/Sold Via EHR & FICO MAS: Will mental health care providers ever focus on those who have actual mental health issues? The only thing that anyone now seems to care about is addiction medicine That is crap drug(opioid/heroin) addicts made a choice at some point they chose to abuse opioids and that is a crime Crikey the dangers of opioids were the focus of a long running TV series (House) and post successful long running “DARE” educational programs the opioid epidemic is an excuse by pharma/politicians to generate billions of PROFIT And cartel gangs like MS-13 just exacerbated the situation/access as did the opioid bill Hospital inpatient wards like Sentara are all about increasing revenue/profit as well to cut expensive nursing staff they now have one co-ed locked ward that combines abused/trauma/MDD patients with criminals detoxing before they go to jail There is no actual individual or group therapy there are techs who act just as babysitters The MDs forget to write prescriptions and are masters of the $400 handshake Criminals/addicts stay free get top quality concierge care eating disorders MDD PTSD get screwed via $10000 2 night stay/hold for NO CARE just when they needed a thorough health/psych eval to determine if/what other pharma based treatments might be more effective –and the therapist at the medical school said the only way was via inpatient These are worse health care conditions than those that existed 30-50 years ago Bottom line addicts and autism are it No one gives a fig about anyone else Do you think this will ever change? If not the suicide rate will skyrocket in the next 1-3 years Heck it is easy to get end of life drugs but impossible to use lethal injection for criminals on death row because no one wants to make new drugs for use in criminal lethal injections but helping the terminally ill and elderly wanting to die by a different set of lethal drugs is cause for social celebration So how does one tell a psychiatrist they like/worked with for a few years that in all probability at some point a year or two down the road there is a an increasing risk that society & low quality (value based) cheap toxic high side effect laden generic meds and lower quality of overall drive through heath care will trigger/drive them to suicide? Especially now that every call to a GP seems to result in the receptionist asking for a social security number and upon opening your EHR containing mental health hospitalization dets well immediately their tone changes to a rude condescending judgmental “you are wasting my time” because you spent time (MDD/PTSD) in the psych ward the next available apt is 5 months from now,No Distortion

Hi I am having a tough go in my marriage We met when both of us were recovering from a breakup My now husband was going through a divorce and hindsight he probably needed more time to “heal” We moved in together after dating one year and then married a year later A few months before the wedding I began to notice his irritability with me and his depression We would fight and argue and never resolve I felt that I couldn’t talk to him about anything because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry My husband has now started Zoloft (about 3 mos) and he sees a separate counselor We went to a couple’s counselor for a year and unfortunately she thought it best to go to another therapist being we weren’t getting anywhere and she thought we needed someone more “direct and a structured approach” Last night we started with another therapist who is focused on EFT After the session I brought something up at dinner and my husband again got defensive and later angry It’s easier to not “talk” to him at all I am torn being we have only been married for 7 months and the road seems very long We are not getting our emotional mental or physical needs met Would you recommend a certain type of counselor? It’s overwhelming with who to pick I don’t know if an EFT approach is best for directness and structured? Is it worth fighting for?

I can’t seem to find anything on this when I search the net- sorry if this isn’t the place for it but I’m not sure where else to look My question is more or less is it considered within the norm for ones go-to response when faced with a dangerous situation to be sexual offering?

I’ve never acted on it as I have never personally been in a situation that would illicit that response but when I’m watching or reading anything scary or thrilling I always find myself chanting “Seduce the antagonist” in the back of my mind and honestly believe that if i were in a situation similar to the one’s I’m watching/reading that My response would be the same I’m a bit worried to say the least is this predisposition at all normal?,No Distortion
So I’ve had a rough time recently and I have depression and anxiety issues I went over to a friends house last night and we were just talking in her room Then we moved out into a little tree-pod thingy (I don’t really know how to explain it better than that sorry) After awhile we were talking about the way we were imagining a creature that had the head of a guy from the Russian Sleep Experiment and the body of the creepypasta ‘The Rake’ After that we really started to get freaked out We closed our eyes so we didn’t look out the windows anymore and we started to imagine it staring at us I could almost feel it watching me We both stopped talking and it continued to stare at me but eventually it was just gone and I was in my idea of a ‘perfect room’ Someone was sewing my mouth shut and I could feel the pain in my lips I kept breaking the thread it was using but it just kept sewing it layer by layer by layer Finally I couldn’t talk anymore I couldn’t breathe My hands felt numb and my arms were shaking Awhile later I was conscious of my surroundings again and I could feel my mouth I couldn’t move it open I ran my hands over it and the thread was gone and my lips were unharmed I could still feel the pain and a tingling sensation in my ribs My friend said she experienced something similar to this (We both have depression and anxiety problems) We don’t know what to do it felt so real and we had another one after it Has anyone had something similar happen?

For many years now my partner has insisted he needs to rest a lot He rests for hours after coming home from work and spends all afternoon on the couch sleeping on the weekends Yet he is not distressed by this and he doesn’t ask his doctor to fully investigate this or continue going back saying I’m still tired And when he’s been offered referrals to suitable specialists refuses to go Hence I’m wondering if this is a red flag in a relationship In the past I’ve raised this issue asking him to get his fatigue fully investigated and to take up any referral offers advising of it’s impact on our relationship (limited activities together no kids as I felt he wouldn’t cope with active kids plus being unfair on kids to be cooped up due to their father being too tired to be active with them) as well as saying it can’t be very pleasant for you to feel like this and wouldn’t it be better to feel less tired and have the energy to do things I’ve also suggested sedentary activities but he’s not interested He also doesn’t want to take any medication not even vitamins or trial antidepressants It is hard on the partner as the partner starts off feeling sorry for the fatigued person and accommodates their need to rest to find several years down the track they’ve spent their life sitting on the couch rather than living life And I’m thinking it’s just not normal to have this excessive need for rest yet not be distressed by this I could understand more if he had health problems that couldn’t be treated but he tests as being very healthy and somehow has a high level of fitness A bit of context – he does appear to have OCPD but many people with OCPD aren’t chronically fatigued I’ve extensively tried to get out on my own to build my own life and am now in the process of preparing to leave I’d like to have the opinion of psych central as we hear a lot about red flags but I’ve not read much about this one which can be used as another way to control someone (From Australia),No Distortion

I fake all emotions and interactions and I hate sex: I’ve been tossed around to several therapists and psychologists because at an early age I loved to kill things bugs frogs birds etc I don’t know what it is that’s caused me to be that way but whatever All I know is that whenever any random emotion has struck me I’m quick to thinking about killing It used to be wanting to kill small animals with my step-dad’s old hunting knife but now it’s progressed to wanting to kill people Nobody really in specific unless there’s a person who has directly given me hell Many people fake emotion every day but I feel like I fake them all except for anger I want to use knives and sharp objects to sever a person’s aorta and I want to watch the lights in their eyes go out I don’t want it for the blood I don’t want it for any reason other than to kill I can’t explain it The only thing close to this that I’ve been able to find in my studies is sociopathy or sadism Neither of these seem to fit me though because both conditions usually include having some kind of sexual need Sociopaths typically excessively masturbate whereas I never have Sadists usually yearn for a masochistic sexual partner to torture and humiliate whereas I’ve never wanted it Sex has always been a thing that I find disgusting messy and unnecessary for recreation I have a girlfriend who wants sex and I’ve always just had to act like I want it too but honestly I’d rather be doing anything else than having sex I seem to fit the profile of a sociopath because of the whole lacking empathy thing but I don’t rejoice (nor mourn) in the act of manipulating people for any reason I don’t want to know what’s wrong so that I can get help – I just don’t want to end up having to go to prison I want to know how to control my urges before they control me If that takes getting help so be it but if there’s any other way I’d love to know Thank you,No Distortion

 It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me and that people kept staring at me even if I was alone) that people could hear my thoughts and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me and/or following me Not only that but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination I didn’t hear voices but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice) a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me) and an exhale (right next to me alone)  however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations These occurred in the corner of my eye I would see moving shadows full blown people (I would see them moving sand they would be extremely detailed but when I looked back they were never there in the first place[this occurred 3 times]) and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once) and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly fly right up to my face so I swatted at it but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly because I couldn’t find it anywhere neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm but I didn’t feel it nor did I see it where it should have ended up Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling it was crawling up) Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school they would appear to be crooked and moving causing me to walk funny Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation emotion (not flat effect) I would miss letters when I wrote I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first) I now have a bad attention span and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied plus my personal hygiene is not the best and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse That last part could be due to my dysthymia but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing I never have and never will use drugs and I don’t take any medications Thank you for your time,No Distortion
I have been depressed for over a year now one cause of which I believe is loneliness I have a small group of friends I regularly socialize with I’m very intelligent — modest I know — and have a wicked dark sense of humor most people consider me to a be a joker and I can adapt to most people with relative ease despite my actual feelings towards them However I have no one that I’m close to no best friend I can confide in and I’ve never had a girlfriend — nor even kissed a girl of which is a source of considerable bemusement for me — and thus I find myself alone and contemplating a lot,No Distortion

From a teen in the US: Every few months I start feeling a sort of mix between deja vu and dissociation? Starting last year I have infrequently had this feeling of being in autopilot and being an observer looking through my own eyes as something or someone else keeps going whether it be driving or working or whatever I may be doing My personality doesn’t change it just doesn’t feel like me doing it I start feeling a bit sick to my stomach and vague obscure memories of similar experiences start rushing back almost as though I’m remembering bits and pieces of dreams I’ve had but previously didn’t remember similar to the feeling of deja vu It’s a very intense experience and I usually get rid of it by forcing myself to sleep through it but I’d like to know if there’s more behind it and whether I can prevent it or just let it run its course when it happens,No Distortion

I think I may have DP My world feels very surreal I feel “detached” from my body I want people to see me as my mind and not my body It’s almost as if my body is a puppet and my mind is the puppet master Everyone sees and love the puppet but no one truly knows the one controlling it And my body feels “fake” to me as if it’s not truly my own body I hardly even can recognize myself in the mirror and will sometimes avoid mirrors for this reason I will have moments where I’m dragged out of my surreal state Some are random some have a cause The times that are random if feels as if I have been flying my whole life and for but a moment I touch my feet to the earth and feel trapped The light seems new the people I thought I new seem like strangers I have kind of “hypersensitivity” to the world and all motions feel strange The things I had just been doing feel like a distant memory This happens randomly Sometimes I can be forcefully dragged out of my surreal state usually by comments about my body or actions I feel like a stranger to myself with a sudden awareness that people only see my body and my actions but they don’t truly see me they never can see who I really am The things I do and say seem foreign to me when I get a moment to think about it It’s like I don’t even truly know who I am I’m known to think I have various disorders when I don’t really so this makes me hesitate to say I have DP though unlike times when I thought I had something like schizoid and I’d create the symptoms after learning about it I had the symptoms previous to knowing what DP was and in fact was how I found out about DP I don’t fit every symptom but some I do match up with The feelings are rather mild and are more of an afterthought most of the time,No Distortion

I am a co-facilitator (pro bono unlicensed) for a men’s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn’t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing He didn’t return to the group after the hearing She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned He’s made enormous progress despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse) But he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison and he’s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings probation officers in-laws etc – you can imagine) and we’re deeply concerned about his mental health He’s received no visitors LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support to let him know someone cares But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships – she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops and the non-profit doesn’t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before I think it’s because the people setting boundaries aren’t the kind of people who go to jail very often A large proportion of the country’s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care He hasn’t called — he’s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling I don’t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk What do you think? It seems a Catch-22 but shouldn’t be given the problem of mental illness in prisons,No Distortion

Is this normal behavior for a parent to neglect spending time with their kid(s)? Before I turned 10 my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together However after reaching the age of 10 my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members) This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me I’m now a 29 year old adult and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time However I really don’t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won’t follow through Problem I have is not that he won’t hang out If he doesn’t value his family enough to spend time with them that’s fine But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place),No Distortion

My mother is 50 I am 18 I cant recall how long this has been going on less than a year however When Im in my room I usually constantly hear my mother talking to herself and laughing hysterically to herself Ive went in before and asked what shes laughing about and she will simply respond with “Oh nothing” or “Just thinking about something” I havent asked her about who shes talking to or what shes talking about She sometimes changes the voices as well she does a very scratchy forced voice that I cant exactly describe the kind that would make your throat hurt kinda She also does her normal voice The laughs may go consistently from 5-10 minutes on occasion At first when I first heard it I thought maybe she is just thinking of something funny but its everyday now all day she doesnt do this stuff when she knows Im in the room Only when Im in my bedroom and when we spend time together like out driving she doesnt do anything like it or when Im in the room with her only when shes led to assume Im out of the room Ive also caught her talking to the couch as if theres an invisible person there while Im in the kitchen Please help,No Distortion
I live at home with my sister and parents My sister never leaves the house and doesn’t ever visit any friends although there are people who care about her and often ask me how she is doing Basically she’s at home 24/7 She sleeps a lot and is sad often She doesn’t answer text messages from anybody not friends or even family I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health and she knows she is sick She thinks that she has depression as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder But she just won’t see a doctor I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’ The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go When she’s physically sick she will go but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her and neither can my parents Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her they just complain that she has no job even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues I just don’t know what to do It’s also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I’m the only social contact she really has When I went away on holiday for a month she complained to me that she missed me and I needed to come home I want to be there for her but it is so draining to be the person that she depends on especially because I’m not a doctor and she is not receiving any therapy at all When she comes on outings with me I end up not enjoying myself because she gets very anxious and I feel that I need to mediate that all the time I also suffer from social anxiety on a smaller level and it’s stressful to wonder what people might be thinking if they notice her dependency and us both being anxious and because of this I prefer going alone Please help I don’t know how to help her!

My mom teaches at a private school and one of her students kept fighting with others She asked me to go talk to him so I did The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me I talked to him some more and I remembered that previously I had heard about some kids thinking that only weak people care about others So I asked him if he thought that was true and he said yes I asked him if his mom cared about him (which I know that she does I’m friends with her) and he said yes I asked him if that meant she was weak and he said yes He then continued to say that he would like his mom more if she didn’t fake committing suicide which from the way he told it sounding like she was going to commit suicide then stopped because she realized that would leave him and his 4 year old sister parent-less (His father isn’t in the pictureThe reason behind this is unknown He believes he’s never met his father) I attempted to explain that she just really cared about him and that she didn’t want him to end up living with people that were mean to him I asked him if he would like living with people that were mean to him and he calmly replied “I wouldn’t care They’d probably have knives and I’d kill them” I asked if he knew that when people died in real life they didn’t come back to life and he said that of course he knew that He went on to say that he enjoyed hurting people I knew that he couldn’t hurt me much so I told him that if he liked hurting people so much he could hurt me So he hit me then burst into tears I think he’s pretty far down the wrong track but still has hope How do I help him?,No Distortion

Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend They share custody of 3 teens divorced 7 years He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son telling him his father was forcing her to do it that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks” My bf’s son who is a “young” 14 is sad and angry at his father which is typical of these scenarios This isn’t as you might imagine just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so In the big picture I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic Yesterday she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids works part time so desperate for $ is kooky) I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch The kids cling to “mommy” and crave her affection — the more inconsistent she is the more they cling Sad Any advice?

My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost a year I know that he is the man that I am going to spend my life with and I have no doubts about that We live in his home with his parents and because they are not working we completely support them and pay for everything His mom has a multitude of health issues and is in her 50s she hasn’t worked in over 20 years His dad is 46 and stopped working after hurting his knee at work when my boyfriend was 18 Since then my boyfriend has been supporting them completely My boyfriend is a caring and loving man and his parents take advantage of him They are not appreciative and always expect him to provide them with whatever they want—his dad in particular At first when I moved in things were okay but recently it has been very hard His parents both smoke in the house and no matter how many times we talk to them about it it continues They are constantly in our business and wanting us to run and get them things Recently his dad came into a decent amount of money and with that money he was supposed to buy a vehicle he did not Instead his dad takes my car almost everyday and is gone until it’s time for me to go to work which just leaves me sitting at home I want so badly to move out and have our own place just me and my boyfriend But we cannot afford to pay for our own place and a place for his parents My boyfriend is completely unwilling to wean his parents off of his support and I fear that we are going to be stuck living in the same home with them forever We are only 25 and it feels like we are never going to have the chance to have our own family I get so angry because his father is mostly just lazy and unwilling to work and would rather just have his son take care of him forever He has the attitude of an unable elderly man when in actuality he is younger than my parents who both work My dad had the same knee injury as him and got it fixed then went back to work He didn’t forever stay “disabled” and expect me to take care of him It’s beginning to feel impossible living with them and I am so depressed and discouraged I sit in my room all day long and avoid his parents because I feel uncomfortable and when I hear them complaining it makes me angry Am I crazy for thinking we deserve a life of our own?

My husband suffers from depression which manifests as anger and he is emotionally/verbally abusive I am trying to help him work through everything but his mother is making it harder When I talk to her about our problems she says stuff like “Well he just has a short temper like his father” or “Well he wouldn’t ever talk to me that way” Also his parents are the main reason for his mental instability It’s a long story but he had a very rough childhood because of his parents’ choices She acts like mom-of-the-year while I am stuck trying to work through my husband’s and my problems without losing my sanity How can I make her understand that a) she’s not helping b) her son really DOES have a problem (beyond his depression) and c) that it’s serious and not something to brush off? When I talk to her about my husband and my arguments her first instinct is always to ask “Should I call him?” No that won’t help Why would it? Its frustrating that she passive-aggressively blames me for his/our problems Its frustrating that she thinks she can help him when I can’t I’ve been with my husband for 5 years going on 6 (married for almost 2) She doesn’t see the real side of him Which brings up another question I’ve been struggling with – Why does he only verbally abuse me and not his mother or anyone else in his family? Why do I get all of the anger and abuse when I’m the one trying the hardest to help him and the one with the deepest connection to him? He tells me all the time it’s his mother’s fault for his problems and how she makes things worse but of course he would never tell her that So she gets to continue thinking she has nothing to do with his problems because it’s only me who he treats this way I will also add that we have all been to see a therapist My husband and I have gone together but I don’t feel like he’s taking the treatments seriously yet and his mother and brother went once together His mother and brother spent their entire session talking about my husband and his problems…not their own problems or how is family has and is contributing to his problems,No Distortion

Our son is 27 years old He has had a rocky childhood and adult life As a child he had problems getting along with others and was often in trouble at school although he has always done well academically At the age of about 8 years a psychiatrist suggested that he had Asperger’s At the time I didn’t think this was a correct diagnosis However after years of crisis after crisis I am beginning to think otherwise Since finishing high school he has moved in and out of our home several times At one point he was a heavy user of marijuana and perhaps some other drugs and became psychotic He has problems getting along with others when working has gone from job to job (mostly in the service industry) and I think it’s because of his Asperger’s He is not good with money When he moves back home with us he is irritable and angry and takes things the wrong way He is not totally aware of the feelings of other family members He just broke the lease for his apartment because he was having problems with the people living above him making noise He is going to college and he was unable to do his studies Because of this he has temporarily moved back home once again He is very knowledgeable about computers and hopes to one day start his own business He refuses to go for any professional help and thinks the problems are the fault of others We are at a loss as to what to do to help him Any suggestions?

Hi I have a history of having a relatively short temper normally this is just shouting or nothing serious But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked I hadn’t even realised I’d done it Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better Maybe techniques that can calm me down I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her she is the most important thing in the world to me But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her Any help of advice would be much appreciated (age 18 from US),No Distortion

First of all I’d like to apologize in advance if this isn’t as coherent as you’d like my thoughts have the tendency to be a bit disorganized Please don’t hate me I just turned 20 and I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Major Depression when I was 17 I was later diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Mania I’m really sad all the time I’ve taken lots of different kinds of medication but they don’t work at all (except for Xanax) One of the problems I’ve been having is that I don’t seem to react to situations the way people around me do I’m hypersensitive about what people think about me Sometimes I get really upset about great things I recently met a great girl and we got along really well so I started crying and tried to kill myself Other times people will hurt me and do really bad things to me and it makes me laugh If I get too excited about something like a new job a trip to somewhere fun or even just a really good song it makes me want to die But at the same time I’m happy… Sometimes I think about hurting people I care about to show them how much I love them When my friends do nice things for me I want to stab them and hold them in my arms but I know that’s not polite I avoid certain social situations like parties because I fear my excitement may cause me to become suicidal It’s all really confusing Is there anything I can do to be more like normal people?

Hello! I am not very ardent in psychosis so I thought I’d consult I have recently been doing this thing where if I remember an extremely stressful experience or I recall something I’ve been procrastinating (cleaning a roomhomeworkorganizing emails etc)/an embarrassing memory my mind feels as if it shakes and only focuses on those memories and I involuntarily (I don’t know how to describe it other as being possessed by the memories) lose control of my hands and they/my shoulders tremor (my fingers lose control and shake in the air in a motion like piano playing and my shoulders jerk back and forth) and my whole body shakes until I push the certain memory away or focus on gripping a table/my phone and then it calms to only my fingers/hand twitching until I calm down enough to be level-headed It’s psychically tolling and I am always mentally and psychically exhausted after calming It is only a thing that has happened in the past year It can also happen in random spikes even when I am not breaking-down as when I’m sitting with friends or out at the movies my hands will take control of themselves and tremor I have diagnosed disassociative amnesia and schizotypal personality disorder but I can’t find these disorders being tied to these symptoms anywhere I have only ever taken medicine/psychotherapy for depression symptoms when I was 11-12 Thanks for your time and information!,No Distortion
From the US: For several years I remained in a job which I did not like — actually hated but it paid well One of main problems was my boss’s wife who also worked in the office Over the years on a weekly basis she would say things that I thought were inappropriate creating a hostile work environment (calling me “token” joking about slavery inner-city etc) The worst moment was when she stood in front of me and said “On the radio it is n-word this n-word that” She said the real racial slur I believed she was trying to goad me into saying or doing something I just sat there in silence,No Distortion

My husband and I met in 2006 and married in 2010 In 2011 we decided to take the spontaneous leap to move to a big city which was always a huge dream of mine The agreement was we’d live there 3-5 years and if we didn’t like it we’d leave Without jobs we started our new adventure I ended up falling in love with the city and landing a job that I felt proud of with excellent benefits to boot In 2014 we had our first child together after a rough pregnancy where i was mostly confined at home sick Sometime in 2014 it was decided we were going to move back to our home state (a state i never missed or wanted to go back to) after doing some math and realizing it would be more affordable to raise a child Throughout that year i expressed that I really didnt want to go back that i loved where i was etc His reply back was always that he wanted to go back to warmer weather (he hated the cold) a place where we had friends and was more affordable Admittedly he did angrily say on multiple occassion that we could stay – but i knew that he didnt want to I felt guilty keeping him and also didnt want to deal with someone miserable with their situation We easily landed jobs back in our home state before we moved back and i thought to myself maybe this was a sign,No Distortion
From a young woman in the US: I know that this is a waste of your time since you’re not getting paid for it I feel that most of the therapist and psychologists real intention for the job is really to just get what everybody seems to die for literally For a little piece of green paper I’m sure they get tired of hearing all the same stories of how everyone thinks they’re so crazy or deal with the unbalance everyone has They eventually grow weary?

Or am I just a really weird person?,No Distortion
Hi there I am a genderqueer person in graduate school for mental health to become an LCPC I am worried that having a gender identity that is incoherent to most others will lessen my ability to build a therapeutic alliance with a wide range of clients I am worried I will not be effective outside of a very narrow community I have thought about trying to live as more clearly female or male but this idea is uncomfortable to me I feel the answer I keep getting is that I have to be myself to create an authentic relationship but I think that answer ignores the reality that expressing a genderqueer sense of self often confuses most people and impedes building relationships very often Yikes What do you think???,No Distortion

From Lebanon: Growing up I thought what my dad used to do was completely normal and I had accepted the bad behavior But by the time I grew up I realized that having someone mentally abuse us with harsh words and sometimes physical aggressiveness it was too late Recently he loses his mind he spies on us all leaving devices hidden in our cars He and my mother have been seeing other people openly they can’t get a divorce because he’s gonna make my mom’s life hell if she leaves (has happened) He wouldn’t stop calling and showing up everywhere and threatening to hurt her And if she stays it’s all the same it’s horrible He’s even dating her only best friend to make matters worse And he keeps pointing fingers and saying that mom ruined his life while all along he was the one who was always losing his temper and threatening us and making our lives hell He’s pretty much normally a very caring generous person but he’s lost that bit because there’s like a little devil in his head sparking up a thing to get overly mad about … this is not even scratching the surface of what I have to say but I’ve tried taking him to therapy He just won’t go and we can’t afford a good therapist I need help because I’m on the verge of breaking down 24 years of my life have gone by with horrific waves of madness I just need to help him I don’t know where to begin,No Distortion

Your opinion?

My son came home from Colorado and has been drinking and smoking pot for about a year When he came home he was a little paranoid but ok He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days he said he only drank When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp and they admitted him and gave him some medication He went into outpatient therapy but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds He’s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp again I called the office and they said the dr Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something I am not sure what to do next I have been looking for other doctors but either they don’t take our insurance or they don’t have any openings for a few months Is it possible someone age 30 can be ok and 3 days later be schizoaffective who never had any signs And what medication is good Thank you from a concerned parent,No Distortion
I would like to ask for an opinion on whether or not my father might have Aspergers syndrome based on what I describe I myself am absolutely convinced he does and would only think otherwise if told by a doctor To start with my father and I are not close He seems very cold and indifferent to me and when I was a child he exhibited an extremely bad temper often beating me over very little — such as playing too loud or even when I was badly behaved Other people have noticed my father seems indifferent too so I know I’m not imagining it I have read about Asperger’s and my father seems to display many of the symptoms He has no friends and never has he doesn’t like social situations such as party’s weddings Christmas or New Year He is highly sensitive to sound and light and often complains about things being too loud and too bright On occasion he also exhibits hand flapping and finger twisting He has throughout his entire life shown little interest in me or my brother in fact all he shows is anger Furthermore I have noticed that he feels very awkward and uncomfortable around children even his own grandchildren and at one point wouldn’t even go near them talk to them or hold them when they were babies And when in social situations such as parties or family gatherings he seems vacant — aloof at times and can become very clumsy knocking things over He misses the punchline of jokes and often fails to understand conversations by saying things another person has already said or talking about something completely unrelated,No Distortion

Hi Recently I’ve been dealing with intrusive thoughts and anxiety but this is another matter However one thing giving tremendous guilt is that I’ve recently remembered some thoughts I had during puberty During this time when I was probably around 13 or 14 I was very horny all of the time I would get turned on by almost any female What is giving me guilt is that there were a few occasions that even my mom turned me on a couple times!

When I was in the seventh grade I always joked about depression I never knew how serious it could be My mother abandoned our family when I was little and got into drugs My dad has been a single parent almost all his life In 8th grade I started to realize that it was not a joke because I had it I stayed in my room I drew away from my family and sports and then one day I cut myself It was the only feeling I had experienced in quite a while And then when that became a habit I stopped eating I know this is serious and it should stop but I have no idea of how I should tell my mom who has come back and I thought she deserved another chance I just recently moved in with her about 4 months and all it’s done is made everything so much worse I want to go to the doctor and let him help me (age 15 from US),No Distortion

My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened We repeatedly asked him to call before he came but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go” If we say we are busy he argues Visits are often and prolonged Finally after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request His first response was “You don’t like me” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit His response is usually the same “I may come not sure what I am doing yet” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain He also is extremely rude to us and other guests He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries?

Hi there my mother was diagnosed with Bipolar about four years ago after years of misdiagnoses She has been on Risperidone for about 4 years now and has usually been okay But in the last year she’s had two episodes not full-blown but bad enough to cause us all stress (her family) I have two questions today: Does this mean the medication is no longer working? And secondly her symptoms are listed anywhere as being Bipolar symptoms so I’m wondering whether you can shed some light She often speaks French when she’s having an episode A language she never speaks nor does she speak it correctly it’s almost as if she’s making up words She then puts on a French accent when speaking English and cannot pronounce her R’s anymore She also acts unlike herself by singing constantly or mumbling under her breath as she’s walking around the house It’s been like this for a week now and she’s taking one Risperidone a day…is any of this characteristic of Bipolar Disorder? She obviously has the paranoia and the delusions that someone is looking at her or whatever I’m 27 years old and she’ll act like I’m her 5 year old daughter if we walk outside or in the streets as if I might get kidnapped Please help! I am deeply saddened and stress just caring for her Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you,No Distortion
