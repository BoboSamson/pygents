      "False No Distortion Labeling I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I’m willing to do anything to escape it.I’m just afraid sometimes that since I’m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself–especially since I think during these times that I don’t deserve to get help or that I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them.\n",
      "False All-or-nothing thinking No Distortion  So I’ve been dating on and off this guy for almost 3 years. He is 3 years younger than me. During our relationship we had always had issues. First he wouldn’t call me, he would prefer to go out with his friends than me, he wouldn’t even remember the day of our anniversary, or things like that we kind of tried to work all that out but I’ve always felt that he really doesn’t love and care about me, even though he says he loves me. Also he has lied to me during this time, first once he went to a party and when I asked him if he did he lied to me in my face. What bothered me was the fact that he had pictures dancing, almost rubbing himself, with another girl. He lied in my face when I asked! After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah, he would make me trust him again. Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again, lie to me in my face looking at my eyes. After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn’t have coverage there, that’s why he didn’t take it…(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him…I think he doesn’t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls…we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance…we had sex once after the breakup, I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex…I still have feelings for him that’s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good… What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up, that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times….why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me? I Feel that I can get someone better, someone that would make me happy and don’t hurt me that much…but I don’t know why I keep going back with him.\n",
      "False All-or-nothing thinking No Distortion My parents got divorced in 2004. My mother has never recovered, she has severe mood swings, i think she may be bipolar. When I was six years old in 1998, my father moved our family to Germany because he was in the army. I had an amazing childhood. When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me, mostly because we live in a very remote and rural part of the state. When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. A few years earlier, my mother had to have surgery on her hip. my dad left her in the hospital and met a woman at a bar. They hooked up and my mom was devestated. But he promised he’d never do it again.\n",

      "False All-or-nothing thinking No Distortion Hello. I have been friend with a guy since grade 6th. We were in the same grade and best pals of each other. Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me. He certainly stopped talking to me. No contacts at all for 8 months. But I still loved him n I still do. I was always concerned about him. So kept a detail about him through his brother and friends but he fought with them too. At a point of time he broke all his ties with everyone and entered a new life.\n",
      "True No Distortion No Distortion About a year ago to the month, I was in the midst of a very painful break-up during my senior year of college. I had been with my ex for 2 years, it was a very serious relationship, we lived together, and the split was entirely unexpected. In retrospect, the relationship was unhealthy… I changed/compromised myself a lot to try and appease my ex, to fit into his life, and I think I convinced myself that I was happy regardless.\n",
