      "the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee, which had over-all charge of the election, \"deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta\" for the manner in which the election was conducted.\n",
      "the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible \"irregularities\" in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr..\n",
      "\"only a relative handful of such reports was received\", the jury said, \"considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city\".\n",
      "the jury said it did find that many of georgia's registration and election laws \"are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous\".\n",
      "it recommended that fulton legislators act \"to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them\".\n",
      "the grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said \"are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments\".\n",

      "the jurors said they realize \"a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties\".\n",
      "nevertheless, \"we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds\", the jurors said. \"failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden\" on fulton taxpayers.\n",
      "the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.\n",
      "#wards protected#\n",
      "the jury said it found the court \"has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations\" of two previous grand juries, the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee.\n",
      "\"these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms\", the jury said.\n",
      "regarding atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended \"that when the new management takes charge jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences\".\n",
      "the jury did not elaborate, but it added that \"there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable\".\n",

      "in the blue ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.\n",
      "despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to republicans who attended.\n",
      "when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there were no dissents.\n",
      "the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses must be taken: _1._ five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or _2._ the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system- a system which the party opposes in its platform.\n",

      "the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities.\n",
      "vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov. marvin griffin.\n",

      "the resolution, which barber tossed into the house hopper friday, will be formally read monday. it says that \"in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds\", the state board of education should be directed to \"give priority\" to teacher pay raises. _colquitt_- after a long, hot controversy, miller county has a new school superintendent, elected, as a policeman put it, in the \"coolest election i ever saw in this county\".\n",

      "\"this was the coolest, calmest election i ever saw\", colquitt policeman tom williams said. \"being at the polls was just like being at church. i didn't smell a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble\".\n",
      "the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however. it was marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.\n",
      "the former county school superintendent, george p. callan, shot himself to death march 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.\n",
      "during the election campaign, both candidates, davis and bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls. ordinary williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.\n",
      "many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls, and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.\n",
      "sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise.\n",
      "\"everything went real smooth\", the sheriff said. \"there wasn't a bit of trouble\". _austin, texas_- committee approval of gov. price daniel's \"abandoned property\" act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers.\n",
      "daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures, in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation.\n",
      "under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.\n",
      "daniel termed \"extremely conservative\" his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug. 31.\n",
      "he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books \"since texas was a republic\". it permits the state to take over bank accounts, stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more.\n",
      "the bill, which daniel said he drafted personally, would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer. the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property, daniel declared.\n",
      "dewey lawrence, a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.\n",

      "rep. charles e. hughes of sherman, sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount \"to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance and pipeline companies\".\n",
      "his contention was denied by several bankers, including scott hudson of sherman, gaynor b. jones of houston, j. b. brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin.\n",
      "cox argued that the bill is \"probably unconstitutional\" since, he said, it would impair contracts.\n",

      "there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house.\n",
      "it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here.\n",
      "operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas, harris, bexar, tarrant and el paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed, parkhouse told the senate.\n",
