They heard the game start, and pushed forward. No announcements were made.\n\nPoor design of the stadium, insufficient signage and lack of stewarding meant that far too many people were trying to get into two pens behind the goal which were surrounded by high fences. Once in a pen, the only way out was through a small gate at the back; the crush stopped them using that.\n\nI covered this disaster in the most recent episode of the Great Disasters podcast, if you'd like to hear more detail.""]"
