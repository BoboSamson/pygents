How Ruby Franke’s crimes helped spark change for Utah's family vlogging space,2025-04-02 22:14:20,"['**From Fortesa Latifi, journalist focusing on family vloggers and child influencers:**\n\nThe fallout of Ruby Franke’s arrest was intense. For detractors of family vloggers and mom influencers, Franke’s arrest was proof positive that their suspicions were correct and something ominous was lurking under the perfect veneer of social media fame. Anti-vlogging advocates had the feeling that the bottom was finally falling out of a deeply rotten industry. Buffeted by the moment, Shari Franke, the eldest child of Ruby Franke, spoke in front of the Utah Legislature, saying, “There is no ethical or moral family vlogger.”\xa0\n\nIn the wake of the Franke family tragedy, calls for protections for kids of influencers have intensified. Though people often assume that child influencers are covered under legal protections for child actors, they’re not. In 46 of 50 states, it’s legal for parents to feature their kids in monetized or sponsored content without paying the children for their labor.\n\nRead more: [https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/youtube-star-ruby-frankes-horrific-crimes-helped-changed-utahs-family-rcna199167](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/youtube-star-ruby-frankes-horrific-crimes-helped-changed-utahs-family-rcna199167)', ""Her crimes had nothing to do with being an influencer and everything to do with being a Mormon wackadoo.

This is not a statement made in ignorance of the facts, this is a statement that omits the facts for deliberate effect.\n\nThe statement being hyperbolic.\nAbsolutely fine in isolation to be hyperbolic, however, when doing so omits nuance it can cast doubts on why someone ignores nuance. An example of this would be the UK's grooming gang scandal and certain commentators silence on white British nonces.\n\nThe statement being unnecessary.\nWe know so little about what has happened to this lady, other than her grevious injuries. We can assume that it is a man or men who have hurt her and whoever it is hopefully they get caught in a country that will take it seriously. But the conversation could be on the dangers of sexwork, the dangers of different countries and their regressive attitudes, the sick perversions of the wealthy. Instead it's the dangers of men. As if the only notable thing about this man is his gender and not his ethnicity, culture, social status, hair colour, first letter of his name, height, weight or shoe size.\n\nThe statement is denigrating men.\nThe statement targets men. That is evident as man is the only category listed.\n\n\nTo highlight my reasoning, I will make a controversial statement for purely rhetorical purposes. The statement I believe is racist, not to tell anyone how to feel, but I am not trying to make anyone feel put upon based on immutable characteristics.\n\nTry replacing men/man with 'Black men/black man' in the statement. 'Not all black men but always a black man'. Because anyone who has ever seen a white supremacist on the Internet is presumably aware of the 13/52 or 13/90 dogwhistle, so there are actually comparable statistics to what we will agree to be the correlation between criminality and gender that they will wheel out. I would like to think we can identify the statement about black men as being racist independent of an outdated crime study. But if that statement is racist for being untrue, hyperbolic, unnecessary and denigrating black men, why would the statement about all men not be misandrist?\n\nThis is my logic. You can argue against it, but I don't think its fair to call it disingenuous because it's what I believe. I think that making inflammatory and untrue statements about women is misogynistic 'women are gold diggers' and I think that i think that making inflammatory and untrue statements about men is misandrist.\n\nEdited for formatting"", ""To clarify, my point originally was about glazing over misandry, which you have appeared to have done, but that's fine, as you're providing a much more interesting conversation.\nDid you take that as a lack of understanding of statistics? The vast majority (happy to assume 95%) of violent criminals are men. That is an incontrovertible fact. However, that fact that it is not 100% suggests that some violent criminals are women. That's all the understanding of statistics that is required.\nI'm glad you brought up the mental disorder thing, as I remember a 2014 study of 280~ murderers (pretty sure all men lol) conducted by the university of Glasgow indicated 28% of them had multiple symptoms that would lead to a diagnosis of ASD. One single disorder. Given how many anti-social behavioural conditions exist in diagnosis manuals I would not be surprised if we could broadly say 30% (low end estimate) of criminals have either a behavioural, mood or developmental disorder. I'm not sure if the research exists and I don't fancy moving into minority report territory, so I would rather that not be the focus of the conversation, but I think the jury is still out on a 5% correlation.\n\nMen are, as a category, much more dangerous than women. On average, faster, stronger, more prone to violent tendencies and have less control over managing violent tendencies, and engage in activities that require or encourage violence, and in ways even modern society has encouraged men to be more violent than women. And unsurprisingly, they make up the vast majority of convicted violent criminals, and probably a slightly lower but still vast majority of alleged violent criminals.\n\nIf anyone came to the belief that I didn't know men commit crimes, I hope this has been cleared up.\n\nI don't accept that violence of any kind is a non-issue. That may not be your intention, but that comes off as marginalisation of innocent victims.\n\nBut i would genuinely really like to hear some suggestions of how we limit suffering experienced by all people. If you have ones unique to women and girls, I would like to hear those aswell."", ""Thanks. I don't know why I shared, but the response has been comforting."", 'Why not share?

Would that happen if the genders were reversed?', 'I once talked a friend out of going down this path with a student when she was a guidance counselor and volunteer swim coach at a high school. She is not someone I would have ever thought would make this kind of mistake and yet, she almost did. \n\nShe was right around the same age as this teacher. She had moved with her husband to a new city so he could pursue his education. She didn’t really have any friends and no family close by. Her husband got wrapped up in school and paid little attention to her or their new marriage. She was so lonely and because she was close in age to the students she was coaching, she viewed them as peers. They had similar interests in shows, music, hobbies so I could see why she felt like they were her friends. Snapchat had just become a thing and one weekend when she was home visiting and we were hanging out, they were snapping her photos of them partying and drinking. I told her she needed to delete the app immediately because if those kids went out and got into some sort of accident or were caught, she could be held liable to some degree because she was an adult and knew about their illegal actions and went along with it. I told her they weren’t really her friends, they were her students. I pointed out they weren’t asking her to go to the movies with them or grab dinner on the weekends or go shopping after school. I asked her if should have gone to that party if they asked her too since they were all underage. I think she realized how absurd it would be for her to do any of those things with them but it still wasn’t enough for her to delete the app. \n\nNot long after that, she was again home visiting and we were hanging out. She shared with me that she was attracted to one of her students and she thought he was interested in her as well. She was like a giddy school girl talking about him. He was the cool senior guy all the girls liked, he was the best swimmer on the swim team, he had a free ride to a good college, etc etc. I was so worried about her making a mistake that would ruin her life and career, I remember calling her everyday the following week after we had that conversation to ask her if she had deleted Snapchat yet and to reiterate some of the things I had told her before. I pointed out that she was fantasizing about a man that was actually a boy. I made sure to put it into context for her:: his mom probably still changed his sheets, probably still did his laundry, probably still bought his underwear and socks and school clothes. I reminded her he didn’t go grocery shopping or pay an electricity bill or mortgage. I told her she wasn’t being realistic with how she viewed this boy. I do remember her saying at one point that I was right, and she did end up deleting Snapchat and sort of distancing herself from the students. But that could be because the season ended and she wasn’t spending as much time with them outside of school hours and the school year also ended, they all went off to college so maybe I had nothing to do with her not making a mistake she would regret. \n\nWhat I learned from that situation was the lack of attention from her husband in her marriage coupled with her loneliness and no support system, lead her to lose rationality. She was seriously considering taking things further with this teenage student because she interpreted his flirtatious acts in a more adult way than he probably intended them. He was a kid being driven by hormones, she was an adult looking for adult companionship and validation. I don’t obliviously condone the behavior but I somewhat can understand that when a female does something like this with a male student, it is usually always because something is lacking in their personal life and not ever because they are an actual pedophile attracted to young boys. Usually the boys these types of things happen with are the captain of the football team, and the prom king, and the hottest guy in school.

It doesn’t make sense.', ""I'm pretty much 100% sure she drowned. The thing about this case is that the *direction* that any foul play activity would've occurred is pretty much a no-brainer - away from the ocean - and we know from what the media has released that no cameras in the area captured any sign of anything suspicious. The general area that she went missing is predominantly (if not completely) a tourist area, packed with hotels and resorts. The Hotel Riu Republica Punta Cana itself is surrounded by tourist accommodations in all directions, I checked on google maps. If any activity that could've potentially aroused suspicion did occur, it, almost unquestionably, would've been seen by police checking the footage (or seen by people, but it happened at night, so we can assume no one saw anything that did happen), but they haven't released any updates about any suspicious findings. If she was indeed kidnapped, they would've have had to pass the hotel gates, she would've screamed. \n\nBesides, these tourist areas likely receive more security funding than the rest of the country, because the government would want to ideally avoid troubles with foreign countries if their citizens get killed/hurt/kidnapped, especially if it was because of terrorism or something, and obviously they want to attract foreigners ($$$) by keeping the country relatively safe.\n\nYes Riibe was asleep, or at least so he claims, and it was very early morning, and it's likely that no one would've heard any sounds of distress made by her if she was forcibly taken. It's also likely that given her drunken state, she probably was unable to know that she was in danger, or physically resist. However, like I said, I'm pretty sure all people entering the resort grounds must pass through the gates, and must show proof of accommodation like hotel card/passport etc. There's also the theory - albeit really far-fetched/unlikely, & I really don't wanna potentially spark a false smear campaign against someone who's most likely innocent, but still hear me out - that *maybe,* just ***maybe***, Riibe is lying, & since he was a guest, and thus presumably had his hotel card on him at the beach, could've assisted any potential kidnappers in forcibly taking her away. But if the hotel requires proof to enter, unless he was working with another guest/hotel staff, how would he have given the card to someone outside?\n\nUnless they painstakingly coordinated and planned and combed through every single detail that could've made such an operation possible without being caught, ***so*** meticulously and carefully, down to literally the last milli-meter, down to literally the last grain of sand - which we can probably just say from the get-go did not happen - it would not have been possible."", '[deleted]', 'Did she wear a wearable device on her wrist?

Are we looking to impose additional penalties for the suspects already within reach, or improve the odds of law enforcement catching more technically savvy offenders? Given the extensive capabilities modern computers afford the user, expectations should be kept in check.\xa0\n\nThere really aren’t any reasonable technical measures that could be put into place to prevent this happening. Open source AI image generation already exists, so technical enforcement of guard rails and such is not feasible. Additionally, AI image generation can be run locally on consumer hardware (albeit high-end hardware, but still stuff most people can acquire relatively easily if they want), so individuals would be able to evade attempts at monitoring (harder to monitor an individual pc than a cloud server cluster). And if an individual is smart enough to keep their criminal activity on only hardware they control, there may not even be enough exposed to obtain a search warrant (let alone measures that can thwart a search such as encryption). We’re relying greatly on the suspect to make a serious op-sec error, which is not a given.\xa0\n\nBasically, unless we feel like changing the very core of the general purpose computing paradigm, the technical side of enforcement had long since been ceded.\xa0\n\nSo the next best thing is deterrence. To make the criminal penalties of hypothetical laws so steep, that it may draw attention. Though this won’t stop someone with the knowledge and means to conceal their activity. You’d give a much harder smack to the more impulsive criminal though.\xa0\n\nAnother option may be to allow provision for a civil case or penalties to occur, perhaps with enhanced damages should certain criteria be met (a minor’s likeness being used in such creation, for example). Civil Courts operate on far less stringent rules and standard of proof, with the possibility of Adverse Inference if a defendant does not provide usable discovery to the court (which is not permissible in Criminal Court). And if the defendant does provide evidence, that may also be later used in criminal proceedings.\xa0\n\nNot sure how we’d protect against false accusations though without unduly violating privacy.

Here’s a quick excerpt:\n\n>Attorney Scott Greene warned those present in a Louisiana courtroom last September that the video they were about to see was disturbing. Created as part of a murder investigation, the 1993 tape showed a dentist repeatedly grinding a dental mold of the suspect’s teeth into the face and arm of a dead toddler during a post-mortem examination.\n\n>Those marks, which prosecutors decades ago had told jurors came from the suspect, were critical evidence in convicting Jimmie Chris Duncan, who has spent the past 27 years on death row for the killing of his girlfriend’s daughter. They were also a fraud, Greene argued at the appeals hearing.\n\n>Nine other prisoners have walked free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence presented by Michael West, the dentist, or his pathologist partner, Dr. Steven Hayne, once stars of the Mississippi forensics field. Seven of those convictions had involved bite mark identification analysis, a discipline that has been called into question. And three of the freed men had been sentenced to die.\n\n>There is only one person who still awaits an execution date based on evidence produced by the pair: Duncan.\n\n**You can read the full article here:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-jimmie-duncan-bite-mark-analysis-death-row-junk-science](https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-jimmie-duncan-bite-mark-analysis-death-row-junk-science)  \n  \nThanks so much for your time.']"

23-Year Prison Sentence for Woman in Hokkaido High School Girl Murder Case,2025-03-07 15:57:37,"['\nIn a lay judge trial at the Asahikawa District Court in Hokkaido, a 20-year-old woman (19 at the time of the crime) was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 7 for the murder of a high school girl (17 at the time) by pushing her off a bridge.\n\nThe woman, along with co-defendant Riko Uchida (22), was charged with abducting the victim in a car in April of last year, taking her to a bridge in the outskirts of Asahikawa, and pushing her into the river while shouting, “Fall!” and “Die!” The victim died as a result.\n\nDuring the first hearing on February 27, the defendant admitted to the charges. Her defense team argued that she was largely following Uchida’s instructions and requested leniency in sentencing.\n\nIn their closing arguments on March 5, prosecutors described the crime as “extremely cruel and malicious,” stating that the defendant’s responsibility was not significantly different from Uchida’s. They sought a 25-year prison sentence, emphasizing that the victim was subjected to prolonged suffering. The defense, however, argued for a 15-year sentence, claiming the defendant had a subordinate role and a high potential for rehabilitation.\n\n### Judge’s Remarks:\nPresiding Judge Yoshihiro Ogasawara, in explaining the 23-year sentence, highlighted the following points:\n- The defendant showed no respect for human life or dignity, and the crime was carried out in a particularly cruel and malicious manner.\n- The victim was held captive for an extended period, taken to the bridge, and killed under unimaginable terror.\n- The defendant, while holding the victim captive, dragged her out of a convenience store when she tried to seek help. Upon realizing the incident was caught on security cameras, the defendant became enraged and acted on impulse.\n- The motive was selfish and irrational, with no mitigating circumstances.\n- While the defendant’s role was slightly smaller than Uchida’s, she participated in filming the victim being forced to kneel and bow, as well as pushing the victim off the bridge under Uchida’s instructions.\n\n### Defendant’s Reaction:\nOn March 7, the defendant entered the courtroom wearing a gray shirt and black pants, bowing slightly. She stood straight-faced as the judge read the verdict. When asked if she understood the sentence, she tearfully replied, “Yes.” After the 15-minute hearing, she wiped her tears with both hands and left the courtroom. Her defense team stated that she would not appeal the verdict.\n\n### Victim’s Family Statement:\nThe victim’s family released the following statement after the trial:\n- While they understand that both the prosecution’s request for 25 years and the court’s 23-year sentence were within legal limits and considered their feelings, they still feel that 23 years is too light given the loss of their 17-year-old daughter’s life.\n- They cannot forgive the defendant but acknowledged that her testimony provided some insight into their daughter’s final moments. They hope the defendant will sincerely reflect on her actions.\n- The family expressed deep gratitude to everyone who assisted in the investigation, offered flowers and other tributes at Kamui Kotan, and prayed for their daughter.\n\nThis case marks the first trial in Hokkaido where the prosecution publicly disclosed the names of the defendants, aged 18 and 19, as “specific juveniles.”']"

Not just in treatment as humans, but also justice. I myself was/am in mental health programs and to allow these children to “runaway” and disappear with no trace is terrifying and very concerning.

They are children for crying out loud. They need to actually set them up for success and help them get to that safe and stable place with a plan for the future and help them also maintain it. A program like this could genuinely help so many. I know there are programs like this but they are all very closed off from each other. We need more programs that combine all the specialties so they can work together. In a spec ed program I have worked for, all the wide variety of specialists and team work together and share their input and ideas daily. It genuinely takes a village for any child in any population, typical or non-typical, to reach their full potential.

Prosecution Seeks 25-Year Sentence for Woman in Brutal 2024 Murder of High School Student in Hokkaido,2025-03-05 12:36:19,"['In a case involving the murder of a 17-year-old female high school student who was pushed off a bridge in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, a court trial for a 19-year-old woman, who is facing charges of murder and other crimes, took place today (March 5, 2025) at the Asahikawa District Court. The prosecution has demanded a 25-year prison sentence for the defendant.\n\nThe defendant, Yuka Konishi, who was 19 years old at the time of the crime and is now 20, is charged with murder along with another defendant, Riko Uchida, who was 22 at the time. According to the indictment, the two women are accused of pushing a 17-year-old female high school student from Rumoi City over the railing of a bridge at Kamui Kotan in Asahikawa in April 2024, causing her to fall into the river and die.\n\nThe trial began at 10:30 AM, and the prosecution described the crime as “extremely brutal and malicious,” stating that “the circumstances surrounding the crime were selfish beyond measure.” They demanded a 25-year prison sentence for Konishi.\n\nAt the start of the trial, the victim’s family’s attorney read a statement on their behalf. Konishi reportedly stared at the prosecution while shedding tears as she listened to the statement.\n\nFather’s Statement:\n\n“The victim’s family has lost all hope, dreams, and willpower.”\n\n“No matter what sentence is handed down, my daughter will never come back. However, considering the anger and sorrow of the victim’s family, no punishment could be enough. We ask for the harshest penalty for the perpetrator.”\n\nMother’s Statement:\n\n“I am filled with regret for not being able to save my daughter.”\n\n“After seeing the video of her naked, kneeling, and asking for help at a convenience store, I was left speechless. How could someone do such a vile thing?”\n\n“Does the defendant understand the pain and humiliation my daughter endured? How much suffering and pain she must have felt?”\n\n“Though the defendant cried during the trial, what kind of tears were those? Even though the defendant was young, I hope for a heavy sentence.”\n\nKonishi acknowledged the charges in the initial trial and admitted to the contents of the indictment, with the sentencing being the primary point of dispute. The prosecution argues that she played a key role similar to Uchida’s, while the defense claims that her involvement was more passive and subordinate, asking for leniency.\n\nKonishi’s trial concluded in the afternoon of March 5, and a verdict will be delivered on March 7.', 'This case is nuts. The older defendant was having an affair with the married detective in charge of the investigation.']"

So, while both she and Jodi received the same sentence, Ruby's likely to only spend the minimum 4 years of that sentencing scale while Jodi could be incarcerated for much longer.

Some of the videos were also very personal such as filming her son shaving for the first time and taking her daughter bra shopping \n\nRuby eventually became involved with Jodi Hildebrandt, a Mormon “life coach and therapist” but she was basically a cult leader. She claimed to help bring families together and save marriages, etc. The family grew to trust her. Jodi eventually came to stay in the Franke home, forcing the eldest daughter, Shari, out of her own bedroom. Shari left for college shortly after. Some time later, Jodi and Ruby kicked out the husband, Kevin, and the 17 year old son Chad, convincing them  that they needed to be separated for a while. Apparently, Chad and his father lived alone in separate apartments after this. They still had regular virtual therapy sessions with Jodi online with the hope and promise of being accepted back into the home. \n\nThe oldest daughter, Shari, who was still in college, was eventually cut off from the family for literally no reason. Kevin, her own father, blocked her when she tried reaching out because he listened to every word Jodi said (in hopes of getting back with his wife). Shari, along with multiple neighbors, called child protective services to check on the minor children still living in the home. Ruby’s harsh parenting YouTube videos were getting more and more concerning, and everyone suspected neglect or abuse, but without proof, nothing could be done.\n\nOver a year went by of the husband and son living alone and having virtual therapy sessions with Jodi. Shari was growing more concerned about her siblings. She seemed to be the only one in the family who hadn’t been brainwashed. She had her suspicions that Jodi and Ruby were lovers. Chad and Kevin still believed that Jodi and Ruby had good reason for what they were doing. \n\nAt one point, Jodi took 2 of the minor children to her own home. Finally one of the children, who was 12 at the time, escaped and went to a neighbor’s house and asked them to call the police. He was as emaciated and had been physically abused. This is when police searched Jodi’s home and found another child in the same conditions. The other two minor children were found at another cult member’s house and appeared physically okay.\n\nKevin was apparently “in shock” when he found out how bad things had gotten after he was kicked out of the home. \n\nBoth women pleaded guilty and can serve up to 30’years but I believe they can be paroled in 4\n\nThe documentary didn’t say where the 4 minor children are currently living but I saw an article that stated they were under the custody of child and family  services as of April 2024.

Even with meds she fully believed that her parents were trying to poison her food, have her killed, etc. Her parents were not abusive, she grew up a great upper middle class lifestyle, and they absolutely were not poisoning her. They desperately tried to help her. \n\nThe schizoaffective was genetic, mood lability started as a teen, a miscarriage and subsequent break up in her early 20\'s was the trigger for her severe mental illness. One of the many times she was hospitalized was because she ran outside barefoot in the snow in January trying to get away from her family that was plotting to kill her. Her parents were asleep. She thought her parents installed a transmitter into her brain like Fern Gully. Why her parents were the targets? Probably because they were the closest to her...everyone I\'ve ever talked to say her parents were nothing but great to her. \n\nBecause they were upper middle class and had the resources, they were in the process of getting a conservatorship over her. Even with her not fighting it (she didnt even really understand what was going on despite participating in it) they had to shell out TONS of money to lawyers/court/case managers/etc to make it happen. \n\n\nBut what if you dont have the money for all of that? Idek what the conservatorship process looks like outside of the U.S. Say you are broke, say you don\'t have the money or maybe even the knowledge to do something like get a case manager, conservatorship, etc etc...but you\'ve got this relative that is so convinced you\'re trying to kill them that they are harming themselves they are so desperate to get away from you... at some point, you\'d have to let them go, right?

AI, of course, can not bring someone back to life.\n\n""I think it\'s weird and because we know her actual voice, \\[it\\] is a little off,” Nichole Schmidt, Gabby’s mom, told\xa0*The Independent*\xa0via text. “It\'s just hard to hear.""\n\nRead more here: [https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/gabby-petito-parents-netflix-docuseries-ai-b2700470.html](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/gabby-petito-parents-netflix-docuseries-ai-b2700470.html)', 'They didn\'t realize they\'d signed that over in the deal they made, or they just were taken aback by hearing her again (even if it was slightly off in spots).\n\nThere was nothing inherently WRONG about this, it wasn\'t done for spectacle, it was clearly done with respect. This is an example of using AI CORRECTLY. Gabby wasn\'t saying anything she never said, she was basically just reading things she had written.\n\nI\'m leaning more that her parents were genuinely just shocked at how close the AI voice got.. it even carried her tongue thrust speech impediment, which is a pretty big step forward for AI voice learning since it previously only mirrored lisps well. Can you imagine hearing the voice of your dead child years later? Parents have emotional breakdowns over hearing a recording of their dead child.. this is a degree above that, this is hearing your child say things you\'ve never heard your child say.\n\nThe ""backlash"" Netflix is facing is from people who have no vested connection to any of this, viewers with dumb opinions on things they have no business speaking on. That\'s it. It\'s basically an invented controversy for the sake of exposure.', 'Has anyone else taken a look at the website they founded for the Gabby Petito Foundation? I was looking at the apparel and one that feels weird to me is the hoodie that says, ""Burn after reading.""

The recreation of her voice very well falls into that line and in a way it’s a form of sadly now telling her tragic story to those who may not have known about the case. \n\nNot everything a grieving family does is motivated by money that’s disgusting to think that way, and it’s surprising that it even has to be said. There are families out there who are still hurting for their lost loved ones that do things like this just to keep their loved ones name out there and tell their story for others as it may help.', ""They're entitled to feeling disturbed by hearing it. Also they deserve way more than just a pay check, don't paint them as money grabbers after the awful loss they had to experience all while the pos and his parents were uncooperative with police."", ""They likely signed a contract not realizing they gave away rights to Gaby's voice to use in AI.

Not every grieving family out there is seeking a giant pay check. It’s disgusting to think that way and even more sad that it even has to be said.\n\nFamilies agree to various types of telling the story for the fact that they want the story of what happened to their loved one out there cus they want to try to turn tragedy into something beautiful and by telling and retelling the story regardless of what the story is on (Netflix, Disney, etc etc) in hopes that they can save someone else out there and spare another family what they are going through, Someone out there very well could see Gabby’s story and it may provide them the clarity they need to leave a toxic relationship. \n\nLastly the fact that it’s in Netflix is a good thing as it has a wide audience so more people will now be exposed to what happened to Gabby and very well in return it means that Gabby has a chance of saving others by having her story told this way on a big platform.', 'I\'m going to reiterate this, but most people give away rights in a contract without realizing it. They may have ""agreed"" inasmuch as they signed a contract, but that doesn\'t mean they understood the contract was giving permission to use that tech. I\'ve dealt with media contracts, typically lawyers are needed to decipher them. I don\'t know what happened in this case but it\'s not uncommon for people to sign away things and never realize it.', 'I agree. Even if it saves just 1 persons life, it’s worth it. Many are in denial about the behavior of their abuser and don’t recognize it for what it is. I can understand why it would be weird to hear your deceased child’s voice via AI and being able to hear the subtle differences but I think hearing her words from mostly her own voice, will speak more to people going through the same thing. To hear someone else having the same thoughts and feelings that they do. Idk \n\nI don’t know why everyone jumps to monetary gain. If I were the parent of a murdered child… I would be desperate to make their death mean something and THAT would be my motivation. If Gabby’s story can save others, her death isn’t completely in vain. I think if you have empathy and really try to put yourselves in their shoes… money would not be the first thing that comes to mind', 'I have never read such a naive view in my whole life', 'Dude you wrote it..']"

Women have reported hearing their babies hiss and feeling like they know deep inside the baby is demonic. I read one report where it was everything the mother could do not to kill her baby, all she could do was repeat that it wasn’t real, but she was too afraid to move because if she did, she couldn’t trust that she wouldn’t do something harmful. So she sat there for hours basically frozen in place until the husband got home and she begged him to take the baby away. \n\nI experienced the very common and totally “normal” auditory hallucinations where you hear a baby hysterically crying when you take your eyes off the baby.

But when I was in college I knew someone who started taking the pill and we literally had to have an intervention and tell her to immediately stop and go back to her doctor. It was genuinely scary how quickly and severely she unraveled. it has been less than 2 weeks and we didn't think she had another 2 weeks in her before she ruined her life in some way.\xa0\n\n\nUnfortunately I think a lot of times that gets written off as baby blues and has a wait and see attitude, especially if she's currently breastfeeding which adds this whole other dimension women then feel bad about.\xa0"", 'I think most people can’t understand it.  I’m a licensed mental health professional and I struggle with understanding how someone could hurt their children.  \n\nAlso understand that not everyone with PPD wants to hurt their children.  Most don’t.  This would be an extremely rare case.  It is more when the depression turns to psychosis.  Things that make depression decompensate are any types of stress.  Loss of a loved one, divorce, moving, having to work full-time while carry for an infant that doesn’t sleep through the night, lack of sleep itself, financial strain.  \n\nThose that already have a propensity for depression are more likely to decompensate into psychosis.  They truly believe they are putting their children out of their misery by helping them leave this world or have a delusion that the child is evil or hurting the world in some way.  \n\nA typical severely depressed woman would either ask for help, hurt themselves only, or commit suicide without hurting the child. They might have an irrational belief that the child is better off without them.  A woman with PPD with psychosis (not in all cases) may have similar symptoms to Schizophrenia although temporary.  If not given help, they could potentially hurt the children.  They can be very sneaky about being healthy because their delusions have them convinced they should carry out the murder or murder/suicide.  They will pretend to be ok in order to be alone with the child to carry out the act.  As heinous as the act is, I believe these women should be remembered with empathy.  \n\nWe also need to look more at 5 things with women that are post partum 1) do they have a history of depression 2) what are their stress factors 3) do they have a support system 4) engage their support system 5) women’s health/mental health and pediatric care of an infant should be a partnered continuity of care.  \n\nObviously economic class does affect all of these factors.  Also, access to legal, healthy abortions to prevent pregnancies in which the mother is not ready to have the child and fast, easily accessible and quality mental healthcare.', 'There are definitely a lot of challenges women face that men just don’t understand, and unfortunately, many don’t care to try.', 'Me, either, as a mom.

These DNA claims are utter garbage, and for several very important reasons. The first is that there is no evidence of any kind that the 'shawl' has any connection to the case. It's entirely based on family legend that an ancestor picked it up at the Eddowes scene. This is unlikely for two reasons - he worked for the wrong department (he worked for the Met and not in the East End, and the murder in City jurisdiction) and has no known relation to the JtR case at all. Eddowes' possessions were inventoried, and the shawl doesn't appear on that list. It also seems unlikely that she would have owned an expensive item made of silk in the first place.\n\nSotheby's was asked to determine how old it was, and their best guess was that it was possibly Edwardian, and so it may well not even have existed in 1888. Assuming they are wrong though, there's still a major issue with well over a century of potential contamination, which in and of itself would be enough to throw the entire analysis into serious question.\n\nAnd then there's the DNA testing itself. What they did was test mtDNA, which is great for excluding a suspect, but useless for positively identifying one. While they claim a match to relatives of Kozmiński, mtDNA is passed from mother to child, so all this really does is show that the person who donated the material found on the shawl shares a female ancestor with Kozmiński's relative. The thing is, that's probably also true for thousands and thousands of other people all over Europe.\n\nSure, Kozmiński is and has to be considered a strong suspect (he has to be viewed as such considering how his name came up in the first place), but the DNA testing is just completely useless."", ""There's no reason to think the so-called shawl has any connection to the case at all.""]"

Deputies said Stone knew his victim as he mowed the lawn for her.\n\nOn the night of the attack, he entered her house through an unlocked door, went to her bedroom, put a pillow over her face, and beat her head with his fist as she fought back.\n\n Juvenile Detention Center Deputies: 14-year-old arrested for beating, raping 91-year-old woman in Marion County\nStone\'s grandmother told the judge that his mother left him when he was only five years old.\n\nShe said that during most of the years she took care of him, Jesse was good, but she saw anger starting to bubble up inside him.\n\n""His actions are egregious,"" said Stone\'s attorney, who asked the judge to show mercy, citing Jesse\'s troubled life and young age.\n\nStone\'s grandmother also revealed that he had been watching pornography, including content involving elderly adults, just before the attack. State prosecutors confirmed this information.\n\nVideo obtained by WESH 2 News shows what deputies said: Stone running away just minutes after the 91-year-old woman was raped.\n\nHis grandmother ultimately urged him to fess up to the crime.\n\n“Something spooked him. He ran out. She locked the door, and then she called us,” said one deputy while on the scene in June.\n\nDeputies arrested Stone a week later after processing evidence from a lab in-house at the Marion County Sheriff’s Office. It expedited the process, quickly leading them to the arrest.\n\n“It\'s a very meticulous, tedious process, but a lot of agencies don\'t have that resource. A lot of their DNA is sent off, and the results take a long time. We don\'t want that. We don\'t want time with this person out there to potentially attack another victim,” said Marion County Lt. Paul Bloom on June 18, 2024.\n\nWESH 2 New obtained audio of Jesse Stone’s grandmother speaking with him, urging him to confess.\n\n“I can’t imagine why you would do that.

She made it clear that the women were still captive and could not afford their own release.\n\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, their harvested eggs were sold on for use in IVF practices. The Pavena foundation collaborated with Interpol, the organisation helping women, and managed to free the three Thai women released on January 30 after paying the ransom.\n\nWhile it is not known how many women still remain on the human farm, Thai officials say they are organising several rescue missions to get them out as soon as possible.', 'Never, ever underestimate a humans capacity for depravity.', 'the depravity of men.', 'People really need to look into the ethics of fertility treatments like egg ""donation"" and surrogacy.

Stabbing yourself 20 times in an attempt to commit suicide?  That's a very, very dedicated suicidal person.\n\nOR.......maybe the pathologist is an incompetent idiot?"", 'Fourteen years ago, on a snowy evening in Philadelphia, Ellen Greenberg was found dead on the kitchen floor of her apartment. She had 20 knife wounds and numerous bruises. Authorities ruled her death a suicide.\n\nGreenberg was a 27-year-old schoolteacher. Her parents insisted she’d been murdered. They fought to have the ruling amended. Now, after years of investigation, multiple lawsuits, and an online petition that has drawn more than 166,000 signatures, the pathologist who performed her autopsy says he has changed his mind.\n\nDr. Marlon Osbourne signed a document Friday saying that after considering new information in the case [he no longer believes that Greenberg killed herself](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/us/ellen-greenberg-philadelphia-case-update-cec?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit). Greenberg’s parents resolved their claims against Osbourne over the weekend, one of their attorneys said.\n\nAnd on Monday, just before a jury could be impaneled in a separate suit by the Greenbergs against various city officials, the remaining parties reached a settlement in both lawsuits. The Greenbergs were seeking damages for what they called a “conspiracy to cover-up Ellen’s murder.”\n\nPhiladelphia city spokesperson Ava Schwemler said that while city officials did not admit liability, the Greenbergs will receive a monetary payment — the amount of which will be disclosed at a later date — and the city’s Medical Examiner’s Office will re-examine the Greenberg case.\n\nAll these developments could clear the way for what Greenberg’s parents have wanted all along: a criminal investigation into their daughter’s death.', 'Finally.

He’s not longer the medical examiner in Pennsylvania, he doesn’t even hold a medical license in Pennsylvania anymore (he’s in Florida).

That\'s huge. Based on that statement alone, it\'s pretty much a guarantee that the current ME will fall in line with Osbourne\'s latest decision.', ""He originally ruled it a suicide.

They all know these are the biggest money makers due to parasocial relationships or pedos watching their children. They are literally incentivized to make these videos. If these parents aren't doing the harm, they are looking the other way knowing the outcome, or they are happy knowing they get a paycheck when little Timmy gets hurt.

I'm currently watching a woman on YouTube who constantly puts her disabled child on screen for views, and her son recently fell down the steps in his wheelchair and broke his nose. She got sooo many views and probably close to a million dollars across all her platforms from one video alone, and I wonder... did she do it or just watch it happen? I'm sick of it. When most her videos get maybe 23 thousand views and then everytime her son is sick or hurt gets multiple millions and in every video she's wearing shirts that cost 4 to 500 bucks? I really thought the 8 passengers scandal was going to change the rules and make a change, but no."", ""You are so right. I hadn't ever thought about it from that perspective. It's 100% greed and addiction to money. The slippery slope fallacy comes into play. They get a bunch of money and attention from a sympathy video and then try to recreate it by doing a little abuse so they get the same results. Once we, as humans, make that poor choice to abuse for profit the first time, the depth of the abuse can be endless. I cannot fathom my child bleeding and grabbing a camera. If I happened to get it on camera, I wouldn't post it. IMO, vlogger is already showing signs of potential abuse. I wouldn't be shocked to hear the child was pushed. It's disgusting to even have that thought and these channels absolutely need to be stopped.""]"

Mind you, thats without even getting to the fact the response was fueled by transphobia. It’s a blatant hate crime. The article never mentions whether she was post operative, probably because she was. Why? Because the assailant needed a phone call to recognize she was trans.

They were in the area shoveling snow for money, but investigators said instead of just giving them cash, Rochelle Stewart gave them alcohol.\n\nIt was a call that came in to 911 dispatchers as a reported burglary, when Pittsburgh Police arrived in the neighborhood Wednesday evening, they soon determined that other crimes had been committed at the hands of Stewart.\n\nCourt documents said she agreed to pay $5 to the boys, who looked as if they were 12 or 13 years old, for shoveling her walkway. Police say as they were doing so, she invited them inside for hot chocolate. That led to her filling their cups with vodka and wine and allegedly tried to touch them inappropriately, according to investigators.\n\n“That’s a shame. That’s very sad,” said Rose Rizzo, who lives in the neighborhood. “It’s very scary. You never know nowadays, you gotta watch your children a lot.”\n\nNeighbors who didn’t want to speak on camera told Channel 11 they saw the boys stumbling down the street but didn’t think anything of it at the time. Police said the boys went back to Stewart’s house when they realized one of them had forgotten his coat inside. That’s when Stewart called 911, telling dispatchers the kids were drug dealers.\n\nWhen police arrived, Stewart appeared extremely drunk and initially told investigators that the boys were never inside her house. Police soon found the boy’s missing coat on her couch and a bottle of vodka that was half empty, according to court documents.\n\nThe boys also showed police a video taken inside the house, allegedly showing her rubbing one of their arms and shoulder.\n\n“Nothing like that happens here. It’s a very quiet community. We have a nice setup in this Windgap neighborhood here,” said Nick Mancini, a neighbor. “[I’m] very shocked, and very disappointed.”\n\nPolice took the boys home and let their mothers know what had happened.
