Kennedy signed his last bill: one aimed at reforming America‚Äôs mental-health system. The year prior, Ken Kesey‚Äôs One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest had brought attention to the crude treatments in mental institutions, and like the novel‚Äôs protagonist, the president‚Äôs sister Rosemary had received a lobotomy that left her profoundly disabled. Kennedy sought to end the ‚Äòreliance on the cold mercy of custodial isolation,‚Äô he said in a statement to Congress.\n\n‚ÄúDedication to improving the country‚Äôs approach to mental health became a family project. In 1962, Eunice Kennedy Shriver started a sports camp for people with intellectual disabilities, which became the Special Olympics. In the 1970s, Senator Edward Kennedy tried to fix living conditions in mental institutions; in the ‚Äô90s, he helped establish the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Recently, his nephew Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current secretary of Health and Human Services, subsumed that agency into a new one: the Administration for a Healthy America, which includes mental health as one of its focuses.\n\n‚ÄúRFK Jr.‚Äôs policy plans have not yet taken form. So far, he has overseen deep cuts to HHS and begun reorganizing the agency internally. He has met once, reportedly, in private with the Make America Healthy Again Commission, created by the president to address chronic health issues; one of its stated goals is to assess the threat of prescription psychiatric drugs. (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.) When speaking publicly, Kennedy has repeatedly returned to the idea that American doctors overprescribe such drugs.\n\n‚ÄúKennedy is skilled at picking up on frustrations in the zeitgeist. The sentiment that doctors over-rely on psychiatric drugs, while neglecting side effects or difficulty tapering doses, has been receiving more public attention. Consistent and affordable access to therapists, or to economic and housing support, is hard to come by. Yet to the extent that RFK Jr. has revealed his own thinking on how to address those complaints, his suggestions remain isolated from robust debates about mental-health treatment. His clearest proposal, still, is his campaign promise to create wellness farms where Americans would reconnect with the soil and ‚Äòlearn the discipline of hard work.‚Äô That idea is little more than a retreat to well-trodden calls to address mental distress through seemingly natural means, and shows scant interest in the nuances of debate around psychiatric medication, or the ways in which separating people from society for such cures has failed.‚Äù\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/72nnKCxm](https://theatln.tc/72nnKCxm)', 'Making icepick great again.']"

I have seen people a few years older than me and a few years younger than me and I will say, the difference can be quite great.\n\nOne thing I notice about younger people who were indoctrinated into this mass sharing earlier than me is they tend to have awful general anxiety, social anxiety and lack a lot of social skills. These problems lead to a lack of community, a lack of pride and a lack of drive. I feel very strongly that these issues heavily contribute to mental health problems. I feel like I got half of the problems, and I feel like my older brother got much less. I would say the earlier we are addicted to smartphones, the worse off we will be.\n\nThat said, it doesn't hurt to question it like the article does, but it would be tough to change my mind on it."", 'TL;DR-most of the scientific evidence is based on correlation, not causation and still unclear whether it‚Äôs actually smartphones and social media harming teens‚Äô mental health, or indeed it is other factors impacting mental health (ie systemic issues such as poverty, or lack of sleep, activity, etc etc etc. read the article if you can!). \n\nArticle:\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a book perched near the top of The New York Times bestseller list about what‚Äôs wrong with kids today. The Anxious Generation (2024), by psychologist Jonathan Haidt, argues that increasing time spent on smartphones and social media, at the expense of play, is rewiring the brains of children and adolescents and driving soaring rates of mental illness. It leapt to the top of the bestseller list when it was released a year ago and has sat there ever since.\n\nThe book reinforced an acute concern among many Western parents about the time that their children spend on smartphones and other screens. In a 2024 survey, nearly half of US teenagers said they were online almost constantly, compared with 24% a decade earlier (see ‚ÄòConstantly online‚Äô), and one-third used social-media sites such as YouTube almost all the time. Parents are troubled by this technology because ‚Äúit‚Äôs new, it‚Äôs different, and it‚Äôs not the way that they were raised‚Äù, says psychologist Sarah Coyne at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\n\nAlthough researchers agree that adolescents are struggling with mental health, there is fierce debate about how much phones and social media are to blame. Some scientists say the copious research done so far does not show a large effect of these technologies on teenagers‚Äô psychological health. ‚ÄúScience to date does not support the widespread panic around social media and mental health,‚Äù says Candice Odgers, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, who has criticized Haidt‚Äôs conclusions.\n\nScientists acknowledge that smartphones and social media can potentially be harmful for some people, if screen time displaces healthy activities, such as sleep, or if posts encourage them to self-harm, for instance. But these tools can also help people connect to support, advice, education and friends. The impact ‚Äúdepends on the individual themselves and their history and their physiology, the content and the context‚Äù, says Coyne.\n\nAnd many researchers are concerned that parents and children are hearing the alarming message propagated by Haidt‚Äôs blockbuster book and major media, rather than the more nuanced one suggested by other scientists. Some authorities, meanwhile, are moving to ban phones from schools or restrict teenagers‚Äô access to social media. ‚ÄúParents and kids are very aware of the narrative and very worried,‚Äù says Megan Moreno, an adolescent-medicine physician at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. That sparks family battles over screens ‚Äî and leaves parents unsure what to do.\n\nAlarming trends\nNo one denies that adolescent mental health is a huge concern. Research shows that, over the past two decades, rates of mental illness have been increasing in adolescents in many countries1 (see ‚ÄòSadness epidemic‚Äô). For instance, surveys of US adolescents found that the share reporting symptoms of depression rose from 16% in 2010 to 21% in 2015 ‚Äî mostly due to increases in girls ‚Äî and that rates of suicide rose from 5.4 to 7 per 100,000 in the same period2. Researchers suspect that some of these trends could be down to increased awareness and reporting of mental-health concerns‚Ä¶\n\nHaidt, who works at the New York University Stern School of Business, points out in his book that the upswing in mental illness coincides with the widespread adoption by teenagers of smartphones (the iPhone was launched in 2007) and argues that this edged out real-world socializing, playing and sleep. He then draws on many studies of different types to build an argument that ‚ÄúThis Great Rewiring of Childhood ‚Ä¶ is the single largest reason for the tidal wave of adolescent mental illness that began in the early 2010s‚Äù. Haidt points in particular to evidence that heavy social-media use by pre-teen girls is linked to depression and anxiety. ‚ÄúWhenever you look at anxiety, depression, you almost always find the effects are larger,‚Äù he told Nature.\n\nBut other researchers have criticized some of his views. Odgers published one of the most biting critiques in a review of Haidt‚Äôs book (see Nature 628, 29‚Äì30; 2024). His argument that digital technologies are driving an epidemic of mental illness ‚Äúis not supported by science‚Äù, she wrote, suggesting that Haidt might be mistaking correlation between technology use and mental illness for causation.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is a large, complex and often conflicting body of research that different researchers interpret in different ways.\n\nMany scientists have looked for correlations between measures of screen or social-media use and mental health in cross-sectional studies ‚Äî which collect data at one moment in time ‚Äî or longitudinal studies, which track people over time. Although some studies have found benefits, others have reported harms. A big weakness in such analyses is that they often rely on participants self-reporting the time they spend on screens. This is usually inaccurate, because people can‚Äôt remember or are embarrassed to answer honestly. ‚ÄúWe all agree it‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Haidt says.\n\nTo resolve the scientific debate, Haidt says he would like to see larger experimental studies, such as ones in which entire schools that go phone-free are compared with control schools. Moves by many countries to limit use of phones in schools offer an opportunity for scientists, agrees Orben. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural experiment, so we should be studying that,‚Äù she says.\n\nThe trouble is that technology is already moving on. Surveys show that US teenagers are increasingly using online artificial-intelligence tools, such as chatbots, which is why Orben wants to see researchers collect data now on how young people are using this technology. ‚ÄúThe crucial thing is that we should learn from this problem that we didn‚Äôt have the right evidence at the right time,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe need to learn for the next technology‚Äú', 'Anyone actually read the article?', 'I‚Äôd be looking for meta analyses of well done studies instead of books to get a sense of whether social media can be harmful at least for certain individuals.\n\nI‚Äôm skeptical of critics if they‚Äôre overly focusing on survey questions and not pointing out how we can get objective measures through the phones rather than asking someone. Definitely some ethics and IRB questions but not insurmountable.\n\nWe know social media companies obtain these objective measures of how much you‚Äôre using their app, exactly what content you‚Äôre consuming, etc, and are known to be reluctant to collaborating directly with health researchers.\n\nSome of these counter arguments on correlation vs causation are not so different from what we saw generations ago and still to this day on smoking and lung cancer (and a bunch of other diseases).

Does intermittent fasting improve health beyond weight loss?,31/03/2025 21:25,"[""[To Fast or Not to Fast: What Are the Risks of Fasting?](https://www.virtahealth.com/blog/science-of-intermittent-fasting)\n\n  \nI rather like Phinney and Volek's takes on Fasting, \n\n# Conclusions\n\n1. The current practice of intermittent fasting has outpaced the published human data supporting its use, particularly in weight control and promoting nutritional ketosis.\n2. There is the strong potential that lean tissue losses can become significant when full fasting days are more frequent that once or twice per week (and this caution may apply to resting metabolic rate as well).\n3. Medications for diabetes and high blood pressure require prompt and expert management when initiating a fast longer than 24 hours. Improper medication management carries significant health risks.\n4. Rather than pursue acute and dramatic weight loss by fasting‚Äîeven if it is just ‚Äòintermittent‚Äô‚Äîit is better to take the long-term view and avoid doing things that can compromise lean tissue and function. Health is defined by where you will be 1 year or 1 decade from now, not where you will be in 1 week or 1 month.\n\nShort story is due to social media, a lot of people have gotten out over their skis when it comes to fasting and may be doing more damage than good to themselves.\n\nI do also rather like Jack LaLanne's take on fasted exercise and eating patterns from his 1960 book **The Jack Lalanne way to Vibrant Good Health**. He ate two large meals a day but tended to do his morning cardio prior to breakfast, presumably, so his body would preferentially burn body fat (didn't give it a choice since he hadn't eaten since the night prior). It's worth noting his methods were designed to retain muscle mass."", ""For what it's worth Alan Goldhamer suggests limiting your fasts to 12-16 hours without proper medical supervision. Beyond that things start to go wrong and you need to follow a proper protocol."", 'Every night you have the opportunity to fast for 12-14 hours. This is what your body needs especially for women.

As women age and gather visceral fat around their abdomen this fat doesn‚Äôt just go away through exercise. Women need to eat more protein and not be in a calorie deficit to burn this fat. The bro science doesn‚Äôt work for women over the age of 40.', ""It's not bro science, it's biology that the human body burns carbs, fat, then protein in that order.

But the federal government‚Äôs disregard for clinical trials is one of the most direct illustrations yet that the nation‚Äôs new leaders have abandoned people‚Äôs health.\n\n‚ÄúGrinding these trials to a screeching halt is ‚Äòcompletely reckless,‚Äô Katie M. Edwards, a social-work professor at the University of Michigan, told me. Participants might still need to be tapered off a drug regimen to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, or monitored for reactions to a device implanted in their body; they might depend on the intervention they‚Äôre receiving for their mental or physical health ‚Ä¶ The canceled trials also include studies on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy; increasing use of PReP, the HIV preventative, among people with substance-abuse disorders; probiotics and prebiotics for infants born to mothers living with HIV; and improving adherence to breast-cancer and heart-disease drugs.\n\n‚ÄúIn boilerplate letters, the federal government has told scientists that their science is no longer consistent with agency priorities or a good use of taxpayer funds, and that the agency will no longer fund their work. That‚Äôs tantamount to being told to ‚Äòstop work immediately,‚Äô Matthew Spinelli, an infectious-disease physician at UC San Francisco, told me.\xa0\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ In the past, if an NIH-funded clinical trial needed to halt‚Äîin an instance of, say, misconduct or clear harm to patients‚Äîthe agency could be counted on to provide money and support to ensure that the study‚Äôs participants wouldn‚Äôt take on further risk and that even prematurely ending work remained ethically intact. Now, though, the government is the one causing risks to patients, well beyond what they signed up for.‚Äù\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/x0vsFWDj](https://theatln.tc/x0vsFWDj)\xa0', 'These cuts are incomprehensible.
