Fishnets literally became popularized by cancan dancing, and there is no historical evidence that suggests they were used previously. Fishnets later migrated from just cancan and burlesque to printed p rn materials and pinups (which despite the popularity of the pinup aesthetic today, WERE originally intended as sexual material for men.)"", 'Here is the thing - Yes, you CAN get high-quality fishnet stockings. My own grandmother had a set of fishnet stockings that looked very elegant with her dresses. But there is a massive difference between high end/boutique clothing, and something that looks like it was made to be cheap and look sexy. High quality fishnet stockings should have a tight weave that creates an illusion similar to sheer stockings, and the seam should be a mere consequence of the production, not a feature. Basically, if you can tell from a distance that something is fishnet (as you can here), it should not be included in office attire. But even with high quality fishnets, their history and origin has always been associated with burlesque and rebellion (ala flappers).']"

Keyword: pointed. Rounded toe will make this look like you got lost on your way to a Ren Faire.\n\t2.\tStrappy flat sandals — Think Grecian. Thin, delicate straps. Minimalist, not crunchy granola.\n\t3.\tEmbellished mules — A little embroidery or beading. Stay in the warm metallic family—gold, bronze, or a muted pewter could complement beautifully.\n\nWhatever you do, no platforms, no clunky soles, no cork wedges, and absolutely no “comfort” brands unless they’re disguising themselves as something tasteful.\n\nAs is: Dress is a 7.5/10.

But if you really enjoy that top then just removing the handing things at the front (sorry the name is slipping my mind) that would help.', ""I am in awe with those muscles... I couldn't see anything else🙈😂"", 'A simple outfit though!', 'You pull them off well.', 'The black ones are fine. I have some similar to those that I love.

Where are these pants from?? Now I want a pair lol', 'Oh, darling — you’re so close to slouchy-chic perfection, and I refuse to let you drown in pajama-adjacent limbo.\n\nLet’s get something straight: the pants aren’t the problem. The pants are trying to live their best low-effort, off-duty model fantasy. But right now, they’re one step away from “accidentally wore my sleepwear to a Zoom call.”\n\nHere’s how to pull them into fashion-forward territory:\n\n1. Structure up top:\nThat bandeau in the second photo? A solid start — now elevate it. Try a cropped blazer, an oversized leather jacket, or a sharp vest layered over the bandeau. You need a piece with lines, shape, and “I don’t dream of labor” energy.\n\n2. Jewelry that screams “styled on purpose”:\nLayered chains, a pair of bold earrings, or a statement ring stack will instantly shift the look from “just rolled out of bed” to “rolled up to a gallery opening.”\n\n3. Footwear matters.\nNo sneakers or slides unless they’re fashion sneakers (think Adidas Sambas, not something you stole from the gym locker). Otherwise, go platform sandals, ankle boots, or even loafers for that “editor-in-Soho” finish.\n\n4. Bag game.\nA microbag, a structured tote, anything but a tote bag that says “Whole Foods.” Make it a statement.\n\nRating: 7.1/10 currently\nBut with a bit of intentional styling? You’ve got a solid 9/10 lounging in those pants, just waiting to be unleashed. Let’s give her a reason to come out.', 'I always liked the baggy pants, baggy pants and tight top set, it would make you feel like a model, just amazing', 'You look CRAZY in the white tube top 😮\u200d💨\xa0', ""A belt could also help!

My vintage look!,2025-03-24 03:24:54,"['What kind of material is that?', 'Perfection', 'Classic beauty', 'So cool! This is so pretty 🙌🏻', 'Nice 👍', 'You could go with a pony instead', '💪🏻', 'Ah, we’ve entered our silent film star on her night off era. And honestly? I’m here for the drama, the mystery, the faint whisper of “I’ve poisoned someone before, but only for art.”\n\nLet’s start with the fabric — that satin finish is doing the heavy lifting here, catching light like it was born to be admired. The color? A deep, romantic mulberry. Sensual, grown, and just slightly villain-coded, which we always love.\n\nThe cinched waist via that wide black belt is working to break up the silhouette, and it gives some definition to an otherwise quite voluminous cut — but I do wish it were either more sculptural or more delicate. As it is, it feels a little stage prop — like it wandered over from a community theater production of Carmen and decided to stay.\n\nThe heels are classic, yes, but bordering on forgettable. If you’re going to wear this dress, in this pose, in this setting, then the shoes need to have opinions. I want something unexpected — maybe a sharp pointed pump or a boot to twist the aesthetic. Right now, they’re a whisper where I wanted a scream.\n\nRating: 7.7/10\nThis has vintage energy and intentionality, but it’s one or two accessories away from becoming iconic. Give it a choker. A glove. A dramatic brooch. Make the whole room pause, not just glance.', 'Where did you get it?', 'Success in your vintage look.', 'Eco leather', ""It's got a cool look to it""]"

Fun lunch outfit,2025-03-21 04:57:44,"['as a firm believer in shawl supremacy, i approve of this.', 'Upvoted I like whole outfit I have to ask is it a dubbed date ?', 'Stylish ☺️', 'Now this is giving: “I just threw something on… that happens to belong to a woman who owns a vineyard and reads tarot on the weekends.” And for a lunch look? Chicly effortless with a whisper of mystique.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nThe poncho/shawl moment — cozy, dramatic, and always underused. The fringe gives it movement, the oversized drape gives it gravitas, and the whole thing says “yes, I could vanish into the fog if I wanted to.” It’s theatrical sophistication, but grounded.\n\nThe belt is doing some serious work here — cinching the waist, giving shape, and breaking up the volume in a smart way. The gold-ring buckle adds just the right pop without screaming for attention. Strategic restraint? We love to see it.\n\nTeal tank + classic denim — simple, effective, and a bit of a palette cleanser underneath all the flowy drama above. The teal color is unexpected in the best way — not too loud, but just enough to keep this from falling into autumnal monotony.\n\nMy only note? A bit more intentionality in the footwear and accessories would have sealed the deal. Maybe a sleek boot with a heel or even a statement pendant to echo the drama up top. Right now the look is whispering, but one bold addition and she could command a room.\n\nRating: 8.3/10\nIt’s casual mystic meets weekend glam — and it knows exactly where the good wine and better gossip is being served. A few tweaks and it’s ready to host an outdoor dinner party under string lights with zero warning.', '5\'6"" dramatic', '🥰']"

This is modern gothic with a whisper of chainmail fantasy and just enough academia angst to make it feel intentional. Let’s dissect.\n\nFirst: the ultra-cropped knit. A piece most would fear, you’ve turned into a statement. It draws the eye to the neckline and shoulders in a way that says “I might summon a raven mid-conversation.” The layering over the sheer black base is clever — restrained sensuality without diving into Hot Topic cosplay. You’ve edited yourself, which is more than I can say for 90% of people attempting this aesthetic.\n\nThe wine-colored wide-leg pants? Inspired. You’ve introduced warmth and regality into what could’ve easily been another tired monochrome gothfit. The color breaks the look beautifully — rich, earthy, almost Victorian boudoir if it had WiFi. And the chain belt? That tiny slice of unhinged glam is exactly what this needed. If the top is dark poetry, the belt is the spiked martini that follows.\n\nOnly critique? The shoes are disappearing. This silhouette is begging for a chunkier platform or something with a dramatic toe to anchor the voluminous pant leg. Right now, they’re an afterthought — and nothing in this fit deserves to be ignored.\n\nRating: 9.2/10\nIt’s giving “underworld librarian with a side hustle in witchcraft.” And honestly, we need more of her.', 'are you going for the hippy look?', 'Damn, thats pretty elaborate!\nI actually have some new chunkier boots! Gonna try them with similar looks, thank you for the input :)', 'Absolutely love that you already own the upgrade — that’s not just taste, that’s readiness. Chunkier boots will anchor that look like a runway finale — heavy enough to ground the drama, bold enough to keep the poetry from floating away.\n\nYou’re clearly someone who doesn’t just wear clothes — you compose them.\n\nCan’t wait to see the next fit. Preferably in boots that could crush both a runway and a man’s ego. Cheers to being the fashion-forward few.']"

It’s giving “corset-core without the corset,” and paired with that sleek, fitted mini skirt, it creates a smart silhouette: refined on top, no-nonsense on the bottom.\n\nBut the shoes? Darling. I get it.

The glasses? A total power move. Booksmart meets street smart.\n\nHowever — imagine this with a sleek trench or a structured blazer thrown over the shoulders. A pop of color in the bag. Or earrings that whisper, “Yes, I do hex people for fun.” Right now it’s chic and clever. It could be iconic.\n\nRating: 8.4/10\nShe’s fashion. She’s logic.

Do these frames fit my face?,2025-03-12 20:31:31,"['Definitely, they look great!', 'The temple length looks a little short (like maybe half an inch to 3/8th).

Gest choice.', 'Try round ones, or even gold colored ones', 'A little too small, you need a wider frame or a different shape', ""They suit your head but not your eyes entirely. So while your head has a proper size and shape, your eyes are quite narrow which means they are not in the center of your glasses. So judging from this circumstances the glasses are to tall. You can see it that the lenses are from the outer rim far more distant than in the direction of your nose. This is also called a narrow PD or pupile distance. So what can you do? Either you'll get 5mm smaller lenses, but then you need wider hinges so you don't lose the widness. And or the bridge must be smaller so the lense move closer to your nose and therefore away from your pupils but then you might an space issues on your nose. Another way would be that the frame needs to be thinner so again more space for your lenses towards your nose. Best would be to have all these options in one pair of glasses combined. But this is a try and error task that should be shortend with a proper optician. BTW japanese brands could suit you well since many japanese have a relatively large head and narrow eyes."", 'Super cute', 'I think they look good on you !', 'Yes very nice', 'Yes! 😍', 'I think they look great.', 'Looks good', ""Those frames fit your head width perfectly!

With your build I’d rather prefer a straight boot cut. If you’re preferring this look go one size up or try to loose weight. But your upper thighs seem more like muscle then fat. So one size up it is 😇\n\nThe belt is not sitting right either as we can see the button of the pants which it should be covering.

"Thought it was nice, thoughts",2025-03-01 01:21:12,"['Cute look! The outfit could be better executed, though - the biggest thing holding you back in my opinion is proportions. You need an oversize top layer to offset the cropped printed top underneath. That could be a chambray or denim button up like the kind you’re wearing, but I’d also also consider a boxy chore coat, which would also look nice with the top underneath. I think the outfit would look much better with a straight or wide leg black pant (or if you must wear skinny jeans they should at least be black). I’d also go with different shoes - maybe a flat or a Birkenstock-style mule for a more casual look, or more of an actual boot rather than this hybrid hiking shoe. This would make the outfit a little more cohesive IMO, but you’re on the right track ✨', 'I feel like if you found some high waisted pants , maybe with a little bit more of a wide leg and paired it with the top in the first photo - that could work a bit better! And maybe a cardigan that compliments one of the colors in the shirt, like one of the oranges! Also I like the first top but maybe when you thrift (I saw the other comment) you could tailor your clothes too - I feel like a square neckline or lower round neckline without the flowiness May be nice ! A little more structure. I tend to like flowiness in my sleeves and the ends of shirts personally!!', 'It could work if the top covered your belly, also if you have a shirt that fits you to wear over it.

Maybe you can tell him what you like to see him in and both of you can make an agreement, that way it’s not you. \n\nFor example, I love when I see my partner in certain outfits and I can only express it why I love it, but I can’t force him to wear it. When he does wear it, I know he’s dressing up for me. So it makes it extra special. I do the same for him, he loves seeing me in low cuts but I’m comfier in tshirts and cozy clothes.

And short skirts / dresses aren’t great at protecting my thighs from sticking to the plastic seats on public transit ( and the increased frequency of unwanted interactions unfortunately). \n\nI recently dyed my hair and used a stronger developer than I’m used to. Color turned out great but my already thin/fine hair started shedding A LOT LOT more than usual. I think I burned it pretty good, thank god it hasn’t just come out in chunks! But it did give me the courage to go short (like earlobe length) with as many short layers as I could fit without making myself into a deflated egg or something.

Go back thirty years and jeans had to be cut much looser just so they’d be comfortable to walk in. \n\nIt might be personal preference, but I actually prefer a no-stretch denim with a boxier fit. The super close fitting jeans tells me there’s elastic in it and hence not 100% cotton, which reads as cheaper for me (also signals they’ll likely not last as long, as anything with stretch will eventually stretch out). I much prefer vintage clothing and try to only buy 100% cotton denim so I might be conditioned to like the ‘vintage’ look a bit better, to be fair.']"

is this a fashion corset/non waist constricting corset?,2025-02-24 16:06:59,"['I own this in a few colors, it’s waist restricting for sure', 'I don’t go far into it, but historic corsests are far more comfortable that modern fashion ones.

Also real corset isn’t meant to be restrictive, it is made to support spine and bust. So if corset feels restrictive to you, it is a poorly made corset or it is not made with your body in mind. Tight lacing is also a no no, there must be some room left in it when you tie it.\n\nYou can watch a few corset myths debunking videos on youtube, they are very informative', 'd’you think it’s a waist trainer/cincher?', 'To add to this- proper historic corsets were a little waist cinching, but most of the dramatic silhouette effect was produced by a combo of slight waist reduction (just pressing on the flesh) with strategic padding in the hips and bust.', '[deleted]', 'Yes, 100% agree!', 'sorry for asking so many question, but if i get it at my waist size will it cinch?']"

I usually have one, buttoned-up, hanging on the back of my door, and throw it on to do chores, and add the tie at the waist to give myself definition if I need to go out.\n\nA cute oversized t-shirt (think Stussy Jumbo) with leggings and cute sneakers can also look great. If your hair looks frazzled, throw on a baseball cap.\n\nFind the brands that work for you and then expand from there. Shopbop is a good place to start because they carry a wide range of styles and price points. If you like a particular brand, but it is too spendy, look for it on RealReal–it's hard to shop consignment/pre-loved if you don't have some brands to start with.""]"

Sure 😊\n\nI was a teenager in the early and mid 2000s and got snatched by emo/scene kid fashion and music. Great times!! As I got older I veered more towards casual; I didn’t really have a specific style and just wore whatever (I also worked at Old Navy and we got a discount so my clothes were pretty much made up of what I bought there lol). \n\nThen I had kids and my personal style was nowhere to be found. I also gained weight with each kid so my body definitely went through a lot of changes and I wasn’t comfortable so I didn’t really put too much effort into figuring out what I liked. But I ended up losing a lot of weight about 5 years ago and began to feel more like myself and spent a bit more time with my outfits.\n\nIt wasn’t until about 2 years ago that I decided I wanted to redo my closet and fill it with things I loved to wear. I got into color analysis for a while and that helped me find colors that I really loved. I did a lot of closet purges before finally getting it to wear it is now.\n\nI discovered that I really like combing masculine and feminine elements into the majority of my outfits and that pleated pants with pockets puts hearts in my eyes! I’m all about wearing whatever I feel confident and comfortable in, despite any negative things others may have to say. \n\nI still dabble in alt looks because that will always have a place in my heart, but the dark academia aesthetic has mostly taken over my style preferences, at least during spring, fall and winter. \n\nSo long story short 😅, I researched color analysis, looked through different aesthetics, used Pinterest for inspiration, got more creative, and decided there isn’t a wrong or right way to dress and that feeling confident and comfortable AF in your clothes, no matter what you choose to wear, should always be the goal.', 'That’s one of my favorites!

(Said with Napoleon Dynamite level of confidence.)\nI recently did a closer purge and it felt so good. I was holding onto some of the higher quality pieces I had in my size 4 days because I’ve always said I would lose weight once I start feeling better. My body was then like, “Welp!

You are never getting better, so you best start loving that body that keeps on going, day after day for you after all the shit you put it through in the 20-tens and teens.” After mental health treatment and much radical acceptance, I hope to be where you are now in my future.

This will do two things: allow the pleats to drape more naturally, as they are being squished by the top, and it will change the proportions on the look. Instead of a dropped waist the look will hit your natural waist and with the properly draped pleating it should give you a more hourglass-esque shape. \n\nPersonally I would also shorten the straps on the shirt somewhat so that the top isn’t as low cut. There’s a lot of chest and shoulder without a clear focal point, currently without styling. \n\nI would even think about changing the top to a sleeveless turtleneck for two reasons: it‘s more in line with the „prep school“ look of the pleated skirt and it showcases your very shapely arms. \n\nThe spaghetti strap top is very juvenile/twee. If you want to go for a more Y2K look then layer a thin cardigan over the top.', 'Is it a dress or separates? I think it would look a LOT better if the skirt was high waist and the top was tucked in.
