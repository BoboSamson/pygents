Help me understand trade deficits please,2025-04-05 14:31:59,"['The “numbers” they have are way skewed, most countries have single digits tariffs.\n\nBut to answer your question, the “trade deficit” is actually in favor of the US. Yes, it means we import more than we export, but the ability to have global trade has given the US a plethora of goods for less money than if they were produced in the US. Globalization also helps countries focus on what they can produce efficiently because other countries can provide goods that *they* produce efficiently. Same with capital and resources.  \n\nAnother reason is the relationships one can build through trade makes war a very costly choice. \n\nAnd finally, trade deficits encourage foreign countries to invest in the US, financing that deficit.\n\nIn short: a trade deficit is good for our country in that we can consume more than we produce for cheaper prices, other countries can provide something that we don’t have building trust and interconnectedness, and encourages foreign investment to finance the deficit, such as building factories; goods that are produced in the US count towards our GDP, even those produced by foreign companies.', ""Trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nTo use a simple analogy, people like us have a 'trade deficit' with the supermarket we got our food and drink from.\n\nEvery week we hand over money to them in exchange for good and they profit. But they they buy nothing from us.\n\nAt a very over simplistic level, it looks the supermarkets are screwing us over every time we visit.\n\nHowever, it is a win-win relationship, they offer us a ton of variety and goods we simply do not have the time nor money to make. Everything from coffee to meat to detergent, the average person simply does not have the time nor skills to grow and roast coffee beans, raise and butcher livestock or source and mix the right chemicals to produce detergent.\n\nWe actually save time and money that we can use else where thanks to the supermarket.\n\nJust as other nations can produce things you want like cutting edge microchips and smartphones at a reasonable cost and at a scale to supply everyone, because they have the unique skills and man power to do so.""]"

Thomas Sowell: Tariffs made the Great Depression worse,2025-04-05 12:35:49,"[""Are we actually going to quote Sowell as an authority on anything?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** and I'm blocked. Predictable."", 'More context on the Smoot-Hawley tariffs:\n\n>During periods of high unemployment, politicians are especially likely to be under great pressure to come to the rescue of particular industries that are losing money and jobs, by restricting imports that compete with them. One of the most tragic examples of such restrictions occurred during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, when tariff barriers and other restrictions went up around the world. The net result was that world exports in 1933 were only one-third of what they had been in 1929. Just as free trade provides economic benefits to all countries simultaneously, so trade restrictions reduce the efficiency of all countries simultaneously, lowering standards of living, without producing the increased employment that was hoped for.\n\n>These trade restrictions around the world were set off by passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the United States in 1930, which raised American tariffs on imports to record high levels. Other countries retaliated with severe restrictions on their imports of American products. Moreover, the same political pressures at work in the United States were at work elsewhere, since it seems plausible to many people to protect jobs at home by reducing imports from foreign countries. The net result was that severe international trade restrictions were applied by many countries to many other countries, not just to the United States. The net economic consequences were quite different from what was expected—but were precisely what had been predicted by more than a thousand economists who signed a public appeal against the tariff increases, directed to Senator Smoot, Congressman Hawley and President Herbert Hoover. Among other things, they said:\n\n>""America is now facing the problem of unemployment. The proponents of higher tariffs claim that an increase in rates will give work to the idle. This is not true. We cannot increase employment by restricting trade.""\n\n>These thousand economists—including many leading professors of economics at Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Chicago— accurately predicted “retaliatory” tariffs against American goods by other countries. They also predicted that “the vast majority” of American farmers, who were among the strongest supporters of tariffs, would lose out on net balance, as other countries restricted their imports of American farm products. All these predictions were fulfilled: Unemployment grew worse and U.S. farm exports plummeted, along with a general decline in America’s international trade.\n\nSource: [Basic Economics, pp. 669-670](https://archive.org/details/sowell-thomas-basic-economics-5th-edition-2014-basic-books-9780465056842/page/n667)', ""Excerpt is from\xa0[pages 627-628](https://archive.org/details/sowell-thomas-basic-economics-5th-edition-2014-basic-books-9780465056842/page/n627)\xa0of Sowell's\xa0*Basic Economics*"", 'If tariffs are so bad, why does everyone use them?']"
Do you support or oppose the Trump tariffs? Share your stance and party affiliation (briefly),2025-04-05 12:07:46,"['Against tariffs. All of them.

Nothing about this feels thought out to me. He simultaneously tariffed over 180 countries at the same and lit the global market on fire...because he could?

We are gonna get what we deserve.', 'Against (dem) because trump’s economic cabinet (? Which does this even exist? Because I at least hope it does!) ignores the idea of comparative trade within globalization. \n\nDemocratic states can’t be self-sustaining through all fares of manufacturing, production, and transportation. The idea of globalization allows states to hone in on specialization in trade and compete in the global market within those resources. The U.S has specialized itself within trading aviation and gasoline products, but that’s solely based on the face of supply v. demand. \n\nOther countries within the global sphere have become specialized within agriculture, automobiles, metalworking, etc. — all of which are essential to the globalization of trade. \n\nTrump’s recent philosophical policy of globalization completely depleted the importance of other countries’ specialization within the global trade sphere, further hindering the growth of not only the U.S, but other states. Without the comparative advantage of state actors, the US has no other choice but to become completely self-sufficient within itself. \n\nThe problem with this is that it can take years to become self-sufficient and that’s assumed on the basis that states are able to do so, regardless of tariffs.\n\nSo to answer your question is a TLDR: as an American, it’s a mess. A true mess. Like, a devastating blow in a landmine that an elected official has convinced a good portion of Americans is safely to walk on. Maybe that’s extreme but that’s what it feels like.

Tariffs,2025-04-05 07:13:38,"['just so you know, there are always SOME tariffs. The rates in the countries you mentioned are quite small. Tariffs are protectionist measures, and they are set in many different ways. Often its on a specific sector, like the USA imposed a 25% tariff on Steel, and 10% on aluminum in 2018. You can target a single country, or many at a time. \n\nYou will notice when looking at my sources that countries with high basic tariff rates are not very well developed. And there\'s a reason for that. \n\nAlso, re:   \n\\>""Like any business, where you always take care of your impotant customer, I guess global trade never considered that US could impose the same tarrifs as they do.""\n\nMost of the tariffs you speak of are retaliatory or protectionist tariffs for many of their essential sectors. Canada for example protects its dairy markets extensively by placing a super elevated tariff on milk(but not all dairy products), because the way its setup in Canada is that the government negotiates a price for the milk directly with the producers, giving them decent margins, and basically a monopoly(win win for everyone). This means the cost of milk is low in Canada. It also means that entering the milk market in Canada simply doesn\'t make sense.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Trump pretty much invented this narrative of the USA being tariffed excessively, as a justification to tariff everyone, so he can use it as leverage to get an even better deal. Though this gamble could turn sour very easily.\n\nI\'m not able to send images, so I\'m sending the website links.\n\nFor each countries\' tariff rate:\n\n[https://www.statista.com/chart/17970/tariff-rate-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/chart/17970/tariff-rate-by-country/)\n\n[**https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tariff-rates-by-country/**](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tariff-rates-by-country/)\n\nFor the Steel and Aluminum Tariff example:\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/economy/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs-hnk-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/economy/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs-hnk-intl/index.html) \n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/31/trump-has-officially-put-more-tariffs-on-u-s-allies-than-on-china/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/31/trump-has-officially-put-more-tariffs-on-u-s-allies-than-on-china/)']"

Lobbying trips to U.S. left Canada in better position on tariffs,2025-04-05 07:01:02,[]
Why do countries put counter tariff on US,2025-04-05 06:53:05,"[""Well, Trump is essentially giving a middle finger to most countries. \n\nFor example, by putting tariffs on Canada, he's basically saying that if possible, he'd like to stop trading with Canada. Obviously Canada isn't happy cuz that means less business for them, so less money for their goods.   \nThen, Canada has put tariffs on the USA so that Canadians don't want US goods anymore. The idea is that by putting tariffs on the USA, it also hurts the USA's production and exports, which is bad cuz it puts people out of jobs.\n\nHowever, while Trump's tariffs everyone and isolating the USA, the gap in demand, supply could simply be filled by trading with other countries. This would be the worst-case scenario, as it would basically mark the end of USA's hegemony on world trade, as most countries are now literally avoiding trading with the USA. \n\nTariffs have always been a lose/lose battle, a game of chicken. Now all that's left is to see who gives up first. Although honestly Europe could come out seriously winning in this exchange.\n\nthe   \nOn a side note, it's even more stupid to tariff, because with the way the world is now, raw materials and production of certain parts are made all over the world before coming to the USA to be fully assembled. By putting tariffs on the Auto industry in Canada.  \n  \n For example, he's already gotten an automobile parts plant in Ontario to announce potential layoffs and shutdown. Doing so would mean fewer parts for the big USA companies who NEED those parts to sell their vehicles. \n\nNot to mention many/most small to large companies have multi-year contracts that will be challenging and expensive to break, if not impossible. This means that all these companies are now legally forced to pay for the goods at a markup based on tariffs.\n\nTake this scenario and apply it everywhere, every sector. Trump is not only shooting everyone else, but also himself"", ""It could be beneficial if there is significant US export there. But this is not the common case. So they simply retaliate. Trump is not hurting US economy - this is stupid oversimplification, so propaganda. Trump is destroying established multilateral world order, just like Russia did when they invaded Ukraine for example. Actions of Trump will have long term consequences only if Congress makes the tariffs permanent. Without that it is a storm in a cup of water. Poorer people in US will be hit hard by inflation of basic goods, but half of US consumer spending comes from the rich. Which is not the common case. In most countries rich spend far less. And they will not be hurt. So there will not be immediate recession probably.\n\nTrumps actions are kind of reasonable. US pushed hard for open trade from decades. And this was extremely profitable and beneficial to US corporations, with the dollar established after WW2 as global reserve and trade currency. It was mostly beneficial for US citizens too, till China started to open. Then other countries follow. And open trade became a syphon for exporting capital out of US. More and more beneficial for corporations and less and less for the people. All other countries, including these in EU meanwhile had and implemented new tariffs. So that part of Trump's narrative is actually true. But what will happen with US tariffs is completely different story. Maybe if the tariffs stay as US policy one or two decades they will work as Trump promised. But if US stays democracy - most hope so, very probably next administration will remove the tariffs.\n\nThere is another misconception - how import duty works. It is not paid by other countries - Trump lies. But also it is not paid by consumers, at least not directly. It is paid by import companies. And they have a choice to put the cost on consumers or not.\n\nWhat happened after opening of China three decades ago is - US corporations started to export much more capital from US. They benefited a lot from that free trade. Other countries like Cambodia, which were extremely poor, benefited far less, but still they became less poor. And China became rich. US citizens were paying the bill, with stagnant wages and lower social benefits. Indeed many countries have tariffs on import from US - EU has such, China too, and etc.\n\nThe idea of Trump is to force US corporations to bring core industries back to US which will benefit US citizens. The issue is this is a long term idea - a decade or more, and probably it will need even higher tariffs. And US citizens will very probably pay the bill with higher prices, and as consumer demand is large part of the economy - actually the largest part, probably with recession. Trump could do that in much shorter time, reducing significantly the cost for US citizens with regulations on US corporations. Then corporations would pay most of the cost. Like corporations in EU and China do. Also the tariff wars will be far worse to poor countries like Cambodia. That could ruin their fragile economies. Trump could start a trade war with big players only, like EU and China, which would not be so devastating worldwide. \n\nIn general what Trump does is utter idiocy, but also there are valid reasons."", 'Indeed, this is the idea - so tariffs will push US car makers to move the factories for parts in US. Obviously that will cost money and also will take time. So for a short term it will be bad for US, but in a long term it will be bad for Canada. Trump is replacing current mutually beneficial in general system with economic nationalism. \n\nThere are valid reasons for that, as the current system is less and less beneficial for US citizens. The issue is, this is not due China, EU or Canada, but due greed of US corporations. And that greed is established by current stock market capitalism, which demands constant increase of profits. Something obviously unsustainable. \n\nAlso what will happen is very hard to tell. As obviously some industries like making parts in Canada can move in US. But others cannot. As you pointed raw materials and production of certain parts are made all over the world before coming to the USA. And they actually cannot be made in US, because of the cost or because they are not available there. Also as you pointed that probably will hurt US hegemony on world trade, as that hegemony is based on the US consumer market.  \n\nBut still there is the USD. And it works partially independent from US. USD has not real competition at this moment. Even if US is destroyed by nuclear strike for example - so no US, USD will still be used as global currency. And till that changes USD will keep US as dominant world power. EUR is not competitive worldwide and China is not even close for establishing its own reserve currency. Other countries simply have not enough economic power.', ""This is the cycle of world economics. Capital comes and goes, making new hegemons every few 100 years. We have yet to solve the problem of the export of capital. Honestly, it is probably impossible. Would have to be a closed economy, which is impossible\n\nYou had China and India for like 2000 years, Spain and Portugal for 100 years, the Dutch for 150 years, the English and French for 200 years(mostly English but yea), then USA for 130 years.\n\nFunnily enough, what made China regress is arguably their isolationist actions in the 15th century, which allowed Portugal to become super rich. Portugal's wealth eventually became the Dutch and the English's wealth. If China hadn't been isolationist back then and met Portugal in the Indian Ocean, Portugal would've 9/10 times lost catastrophically, basically removing any chance of the Dutch and English making a push for Asia for at least another 200-300 years. I think we'd be looking at a very different history"", ""Totally agree with you that in theory, the idea is to bring factories back to the USA. Now, I don't know where they will find the people and the money to get this done in the next 10 years in any meaningful way. \n\nThe truth of the matter is that corporate greed also benefited the consumers, so it's unfair to pin the blame completely on that when we are beneficiaries.\n\nMy only issue with the blanket tariffs Trump has laid out is that they lack any kind of strategy, beyond being a negotiation tool. Because it lacks focus, I think it'll do more harm than good, for little to no reason for the added harm.\n\nIt is also my belief that the USA is not strong enough alone to stand firm if the world as a whole basically turns its back on the USA economically. Even if this takes 20 years, it will happen if things stay the same. \n\n  \nI do think the USD's place as a reserve currency is already at risk because of USA's debt crisis, but also because of Trump's behaviour, threatening military action and sanctions on allies and enemies alike. No country wants to runs the risk(if its big enough) of having their USD Treasuries being confiscated, and this would erode confidence in the USD. If you add to that USA's excessive tariffs, there is a world in my head where the USD's position as the global reserve currency could be reconsidered in the next 5 years"", 'Indeed, when we put if before history events the things become complicated. Isolationism makes countries less competitive. Although Portugal faced significant resistance from Ottoman empire in Indian ocean, but won. \n\nAlso indeed for most of the known human history China was the richest and most developed place in the world, even in the times of Roman empire.', 'Yeah, Trump basically plays power game. But it is debatable if he really has the power. Specially against China and EU. EU is more vulnerable as without Russian resources it needs US oil and gas for example. But China has Russian resources. A decade ago it was completely dependable on US know-how and consumer market, but now US makes only fraction of Chinese trade.\n\nI do not think US is in debt crisis, simply because US debt is in USD. Basically does not matter who is buying the bonds, the debt is internal. So US debt is not so large. Look at Japan.\n\nHow debt crisis starts - take Weimar republic, all Eastern European states in 90s, Argentina and etc. It is not about investors. It is above all about foreign debt. An issue US do not have, as their debt is in US dollars. But take Argentina, they have to pay interest and expiring debts, nobody wants to lend them US dollars, they cannot print such, so the state takes the dollars from the economy. But import companies, private foreign debt, energy utilities - all need dollars. That is why the value of the local currency collapses. That has nothing with printing money or internal debt. Well it has, as after the value of the peso collapses, the state has to print more pesos to cover the government expenses.', ""The Ottomans had nothing on China, let's be for real. Just considering what China's navy was capable of through Zheng He's 7 Voyages, we know that if China felt like it, it could have crushed any Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean.\n\n  \nIsolationism bad, hope Trump doesn't actually intend to do it"", 'There were several Ottoman–Portuguese wars in Indian Ocean.']"

Any takes on the MAGA plan?,2025-04-05 04:58:59,"['Like a EU kinda deal but with a MAGA twist ?', 'Regarding trust, look at it through a historical lens:\n\nMost countries in Europe still have a wariness of Germany from WW2 or from lingering cold war ties with Russia (former East German elites).\n\nFrance has a very bad, brutal colonial legacy and one that is still on-going in Africa with the CFA Franc.\n\nChina is actively jingoistic against their neighbors and has a reputation for debt trap diplomacy.\n\nRussia is almost a pariah state.\n\n\\-----\n\nA small tariff spat pales in comparison. The U.S. has led the world order from quite some time and so many countries are dependent upon exporting to the U.S. consumer market. U.S. cultural mores have also spread around the world linking many cultural norms within much of the world, much more so than many other possible big-power partners.', 'This is not a small tariff spat. This is the collapse of the post Cold War world order. China, Japan, and Korea who historically hate each other are making a joint response to our tariffs. Europe is preparing for our complete abandonment, led by Germany and France who historically hate each other. Britain is considering rejoining the EU as the main argument for leaving was deepening ties with America. All of our joint projects in Africa will be pulled out of. They are no longer buying our military goods, all western nations have cancelled further orders of the F35. The price of oil is plummeting because US companies are trying to sell off their inventories before we get slammed with tariffs. Agricultural products are going to skyrocket due to loss of federal grants and tariffs.\n\nThis is going to completely wreck the economy in a way that has never been experienced. Historically, recessions in the United States have always been caused by free-market actions: the collapse of an industry, the end of a war, a credit bubble, etc. Never NEVER has there been a point where it happened because the entire world turned against us.\n\nHell, the tariffs alone will cause the cost of iPhones by $300-600 dollars and that’s BEFORE you include the devaluation of the dollar which could increase it by another $400-900! The only reason other countries peg their currency to the USD is because of its stability but there is no idea where it’s going.\n\nAnd, likewise, a devaluation of a currency greatly benefits creditors as the real dollar value of debt is debt/price level. So, if the dollar loses 20% of its value, that’s like our Federal government debt going up by 20%. That is the sole reason the Fed tries to keep a high value dollar in the first place. Combined with the ludicrous tax cuts that can’t be altered for 10 YEARS, this is the highest chance of the US defaulting since the revolutionary war.\n\nWe are multilaterally screwed.']"

Trade war!,2025-04-05 01:26:07,"['This is straight from Stephen Miran, the economist on crack who is now driving the bus for the Trump administration.   He claims that countries being tariffed can devalue their currency or cut cost in some ways to offset the tariff, which means the US government get to collect tariff from US importers and the retail price stays relatively the same.   As evidence, he points to Trump\'s first term and said the tariff on China essentially had little effect on prices and inflation.   He thinks the world must sell to the US in order to profit and they have no choice but to eat the tariff by lowering their margin.\n\nMiran does not say tariff is deflationary as far as I know.  But at some point, perhaps the talking heads took ""non-inflationary"" as ""deflationary"".\n\nThis administration\'s whole thesis is based on the belief that 1) the rest of the world must sell to the US.  2) The world will bow to the US.  3) The world will trust the US to keep their promises.\n\nI\'ll say this:  if Miran pull it off he\'d have accomplished what was previously thought impossible, become one of the greatest economists ever lived, and deserve a Nobel prize.

"I'm confused, is Fox News now saying they like Bernie Sanders' economic plans?",2025-04-05 00:16:46,"[""Side note, I amuse myself sometimes by talking with ChatGPT. I treat it like a grad student who knows stuff but whose work you have to double check 100% of the time.\n\n**I gave it this lazily written prompt:**\n\nHi! \n\nI have a series of questions I'd like addressed and then a comprehensive response after that I'd like from you. \n\nIf I remember correctly, Keynesian Economics did not predict stagflation, due to the assumption that high unemployment (and thus low demand) could not exist at the same time as high inflation. However, the supply-side shocks from oil-exporting countries in the 1970s tested that theory and we had stagflation. Am I remembering this all correctly? Are there details I'm forgetting? What did economists learn and incorporate in their theories moving forward? I feel like I remember it being theories on the natural rate of employment and how demand and supply shifts occur over both the short, medium, and long-term. \n\nAdditionally, I'd like to consider the April 2025 tariffs that President Donald Trump has placed on countries' goods exported to the United States and the retaliatory tariffs imposed on American imports by other countries' leaders coupled with the mass government firings his administration has moved forward with. The tariffs act as a tax on imports and shift demand lower for our exports. The lower demand from unemployed people domestically will also lower demand as well as lower global demand due to more expensive trade. Could this all cascade into a global recession or depression as economies experience a death spiral of demand due to decreased demand from both  more expensive goods and less employment? Does this seem likely to cause stagflation?\n\n**It responded with:**\n\n* Your recollection of the 1970s stagflation and its implications for economic theory is largely accurate. During that period, the U.S. experienced simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment, a phenomenon that traditional Keynesian economics struggled to explain. Keynesian models were built on the Phillips Curve, which suggested an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment—meaning that high inflation would typically accompany low unemployment, and vice versa. However, the 1970s saw this relationship break down, largely due to significant supply-side shocks, notably the oil crises, which led to increased production costs and contributed to both rising inflation and unemployment. \u200b\nWikipedia\n\n* This unexpected scenario prompted economists to reassess existing theories. One key development was the introduction of the concept of the natural rate of unemployment by economists like Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps. They argued that there is a level of unemployment that an economy cannot go below without causing accelerating inflation. This perspective suggested that attempts to reduce unemployment below this natural rate through demand-side policies would only lead to higher inflation without long-term gains in employment. Additionally, the distinction between short-term and long-term effects became more pronounced, with recognition that supply shocks could shift the Phillips Curve, altering the inflation-unemployment relationship. \u200b\nWikipedia\n\n* Fast-forwarding to April 2025, the U.S. is facing economic challenges that echo some aspects of the 1970s. President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs, including a 10% baseline import tax on most countries, with higher rates for specific nations. These measures have raised concerns about increased production costs and consumer prices, potentially fueling inflation. Simultaneously, the administration's significant reductions in federal employment, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, have led to mass layoffs in the public sector. \u200b\nNew York Post\n+1\nPBS: Public Broadcasting Service\n+1\nNew York Post\n+2\nReuters\n+2\nAP News\n+2\n\n* The combined effect of higher tariffs and reduced government employment is contributing to economic uncertainty. While the March 2025 jobs report showed an unexpected addition of 228,000 jobs, surpassing forecasts, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2%. Sectors like healthcare, transportation, and warehousing saw job growth, but overall business sentiment remains cautious due to the potential impacts of tariffs. \u200b\nNew York Post\n\n* Economists are concerned that these factors could lead to stagflation—a scenario characterized by stagnant economic growth, rising unemployment, and high inflation. The tariffs are expected to increase production costs, leading to higher consumer prices, while the reduction in government jobs could dampen overall demand. This combination mirrors the supply-side shocks of the 1970s that contributed to stagflation. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential retaliatory measures from other countries could further disrupt economic stability. \u200b\nReuters\nMarketWatch\n\n* In response to these developments, the Federal Reserve faces a challenging balancing act. While there may be pressure to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, doing so could exacerbate inflationary pressures stemming from the tariffs. Conversely, tightening monetary policy to combat inflation could further hinder economic growth and employment. This policy dilemma is reminiscent of the challenges faced during the 1970s stagflation period. \u200b\n\n* In summary, the current economic landscape shares similarities with the 1970s, with supply-side constraints and policy decisions contributing to a complex environment. The risk of stagflation is a concern, as rising production costs due to tariffs and reduced demand from government layoffs could lead to simultaneous inflation and unemployment. Policymakers will need to navigate these challenges carefully to avoid repeating the economic hardships of the past.\n\n**I then responded with**: \n\n* Accounting for the seemingly chaotic and unpredictable nature of the Trump Administration's policies, are there reasons we should not fear stagflation, recession, or depression in the economy?\n\n**It then responded with:**\n\n* There are a few reasons why stagflation, recession, or depression might not be inevitable, even amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration’s policies:\n\n* 1. The Economy Has Strong Underlying Momentum\nDespite the uncertainty, the U.S. economy has shown resilience. The March 2025 jobs report exceeded expectations, adding 228,000 jobs, with key sectors like healthcare and transportation growing. This suggests that businesses are still hiring, and consumers still have spending power—two crucial buffers against economic decline.\n(NY Post – April 4, 2025)\n\n* 2. The Federal Reserve Can Intervene\nThe Fed has tools at its disposal to counteract inflation or economic contraction. If stagflation becomes a risk, the Fed may keep interest rates steady rather than aggressively raising them, allowing growth to continue while inflation is managed. If a recession looms, rate cuts or liquidity measures could stimulate demand. However, their actions will depend on how inflation reacts to tariffs and layoffs.\n\n* 3. Potential Trade Adjustments & Corporate Adaptability\nWhile tariffs increase costs, companies may adapt by shifting supply chains or absorbing costs rather than passing them directly to consumers. Some companies could also explore automation to offset labor market disruptions. If businesses quickly adjust, inflationary pressures could be less severe than expected.\n\n* 4. Global Diversification\nThe global economy is still growing, and the U.S. remains a major economic player. While retaliatory tariffs could hurt exports, not all trade partners will respond with harsh measures. Some may seek alternative agreements, keeping trade channels open. If the U.S. can negotiate bilateral trade deals to replace broad multilateral agreements, economic damage might be limited.\n\n* 5. Political and Market Reactions Could Curb Extremes\nIf tariffs and government layoffs prove damaging, political and market forces might push for policy reversals. Congress, businesses, and even members of Trump’s administration may advocate for adjustments if economic conditions deteriorate. Additionally, investors and financial markets tend to price in risk and could drive policy changes if confidence erodes.\n\n* 6. Consumer Demand & Household Savings\nHousehold savings rates and overall consumer demand remain critical factors. If consumers continue spending—either due to prior savings, wage growth, or government stimulus—demand may remain strong enough to avoid deep recessionary spirals.\n\n* Conclusion: Risks Remain, But Not a Guarantee of Crisis\nWhile current policies introduce risks, it’s not certain that the U.S. will face stagflation, recession, or depression. The economy still has strengths, and businesses, policymakers, and consumers may adjust to new conditions. That said, vigilance is necessary, as prolonged uncertainty, policy missteps, or severe trade disruptions could still tip the balance toward economic hardship.\n\nI then hit a character limit in this comment lol"", ""**I then responded with**:\n\nWhat other factors should we consider increase the likelihood of the United States experiencing stagflation? Additionally, is there evidence (such as Donald Trump toggling on and off tariffs and then providing delays to them) that there may be a group of insiders the President has told when he will turn on or off various tariffs to give them timing instructions on when to buy stocks after the market has crashed and telling them when they can expect a rally due to him turning tariffs back off and then repeating that?\n\n**It responded with:**\n\n* Your concerns about the potential for stagflation in the U.S. economy are well-founded. Several factors could increase this risk:\n\n* Factors Increasing the Likelihood of Stagflation\nProtectionist Trade Policies: The implementation of sweeping tariffs by the Trump administration has led to increased production costs and higher consumer prices. Such protectionist measures can stifle economic growth while simultaneously driving inflation, creating conditions conducive to stagflation. \u200b\n\n* Retaliatory Actions from Trade Partners: Countries affected by U.S. tariffs, notably China, have responded with their own tariffs on American goods. This tit-for-tat escalation can further dampen U.S. exports, harm domestic industries, and contribute to economic stagnation. \u200b\nAP News\n\n* Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs and trade barriers can lead to significant supply chain bottlenecks, increasing costs for businesses and limiting the availability of goods. Such disruptions can exacerbate inflationary pressures while hindering economic growth. \u200b\nAtradius\n\n* Energy Price Volatility: Geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions can lead to fluctuations in energy prices. Elevated energy costs can increase production expenses across various sectors, contributing to both inflation and economic slowdown. \u200b\nSwift Centre\n\n* Labor Market Constraints: Policies that restrict immigration or reduce the labor force can lead to labor shortages, driving up wages and production costs. While higher wages can contribute to inflation, labor shortages can simultaneously impede economic growth. \u200b\nMarkets.com\n\n* Allegations of Insider Trading Related to Tariff Announcements\nRegarding your concerns about potential insider trading linked to the timing of tariff announcements:\n\n* Speculation and Public Sentiment: There has been public speculation and concern about the possibility of individuals with advance knowledge of tariff decisions exploiting this information for financial gain. The unpredictable nature of the administration's policy shifts has led some to question whether certain insiders could be timing stock market trades to benefit from ensuing market volatility. \u200b\nLos Angeles Times\n\n* Lack of Concrete Evidence: Despite these concerns, as of now, there is no concrete evidence to substantiate claims that insiders have been systematically informed about tariff changes to facilitate advantageous stock trading. Investigations into such activities would require detailed financial analyses and access to trading records, which are typically confidential.\u200b\n\n* Market Volatility and Investor Behavior: It's important to note that markets can be highly sensitive to policy announcements, especially those affecting trade. Sudden policy shifts can lead to rapid market movements, and while some investors may attempt to anticipate these changes, this does not inherently indicate illicit activity.\u200b\n\n* In summary, while the current economic policies and international responses do heighten the risk of stagflation, and public speculation about insider trading exists, there is no definitive evidence at this time to confirm such practices. Continuous monitoring of economic indicators and policy developments remains crucial for assessing potential risks to the economy.\n\n\nHopefully this amused some number of you.""]"

I think significantly fewer jobs will be added and unemployment will also tick up.', ""It's being overshadowed but everything else. Though the unemployment rate ticking up argues for an increased rate cut odds. Probably some private sector gains and public sector loses"", ""Serious question. Are people who get a severance package even counted in unemployment numbers? Until they become unattached from severance are they even accounted for until they file as unemployed? I'm guessing a large number of these DOGE people arent being counted yet."", 'From a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report: \n\n""Employees on paid leave or receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed in the establishment survey.""', 'from Gemini the Google AI\n\nIt\'s a nuanced issue whether individuals receiving severance packages are immediately counted in unemployment numbers. Here\'s a breakdown:\n\n**How Unemployment Numbers are Typically Calculated:**\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) primarily uses two surveys to gather employment and unemployment data:\n\n* **Household Survey:** This survey directly asks individuals about their employment status during a specific week each month. People are counted as unemployed if they were not employed during that week, were available for work, and had actively looked for work in the past 4 weeks. \xa0\n* **Establishment Survey:** This survey collects data from businesses about the number of employees on their payrolls. This provides information on job gains and losses. \xa0\n\n**Impact of Severance Packages on Unemployment Counts:**\n\n* **Continued Payroll:** If an individual receiving a severance package remains on the employer\'s payroll for a period (even if they are not actively working), they are generally **not** counted as unemployed in the household survey during that time. They are still considered employed by the establishment survey.\n* **Lump-Sum Severance:** If the severance is paid as a one-time lump sum, the individual is typically considered separated from employment immediately. If they are not working, available for work, and actively seeking work, they would be counted as unemployed in the household survey.\n* **Unemployment Benefit Eligibility:** Receiving severance pay can affect eligibility for unemployment benefits, but it doesn\'t necessarily prevent someone from being counted as unemployed by the BLS. State laws vary, but often severance pay is considered income that can reduce or delay unemployment benefits. Some states allocate severance pay to specific weeks following separation, potentially delaying unemployment benefit eligibility for that period. \xa0\n\n**The ""DOGE People"" Scenario:**\n\nIf the individuals you are referring to received a severance package that keeps them on the payroll for a certain duration, they would likely **not** be immediately reflected in the unemployment numbers. They would only be counted as unemployed if they are no longer on the payroll, are not working, are available for work, and are actively seeking employment, as per the criteria of the household survey.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n* People receiving severance who remain on the payroll are generally **not** counted in unemployment numbers until they are fully separated.\n* Those receiving a lump-sum severance would be counted as unemployed if they meet the standard criteria (not working, available, and actively seeking work).\n* The receipt of severance pay can affect unemployment *benefits* eligibility, but it\'s a separate issue from how the BLS counts who is unemployed.\n\nTherefore, your guess that a large number of individuals who received severance might not be counted in the immediate unemployment figures could be accurate, especially if their severance packages involve continued payroll for a period. They would likely be counted once that severance period ends and they meet the criteria for unemployment.', ""Thank you for researching and posting that reply.

Basics: trade deficit means ,,I buy more from you, than you buy from me”. **Noone is getting free money or ,,subsidies”.** People and companies are just paying from products and services, and getting them in return.\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Trade deficits are **not inherently harmfull:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5029945_Trade_Deficits_Causes_and_Consequences Traditionally they were commonly viewed as bad (which has it’s roots in the colonial-era mercantilism), but modern economics rejest this notion in favour of a more nuanced approach. **You need to look at the causes of a particular deficit to understand implications** - deficit might be a symptom of something bad, but doesn’t have to be.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060**The US trade deficit is most likely caused by international investment flows. In short: US is a good location for investment,** which incentivizes selling products in the US to obtain US dollars to invest: https://www.cato.org/trade-policy-analysis/americas-maligned-misunderstood-trade-deficit\n3.\t\u2060\u2060*£You need to run a trade deficit, in order to maintain reserve currency status.** US dollar is the global reserve currency, which means that foreign goverments and companies save, invest and trade internationally in US dollars. In order to do that, they need to obtain dollars somehow, which requires selling products in the US. **And the US benefits from being a reserve currency country** (American companies have easier access to capital and lower transaction costs).\n\nTrump has actually contradicted himself on that, because **he stated that he wants the USD to remain reserve currency,** while also **stating that he wants to get rid of trade deficits. In reality you can’t have one without the other.**\n\nHere is a more detailed response to your question, that expands on the points I made: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/s/PdQJrebJfc', 'I would say thats fine , but are you forgetting he literally lost an election to biden the first time around? If biden and harris literally ANYTHING for the middle class, he wouldnt even have a leg to stand on.', 'Uhh yeah we’re thinking of the average american here, theyre not all brain surgeons bud', ""Ugh, I KNOW what that's like to lose an hour of work then recreating it. In my line of work everything is a web based tools and auto caching exists but not perfect.\n\nI'm just riffing and these counterpoints, and they are off the cuff and unorganized. I'd normally try to make a more structured output.\n\n1. Okay so trade deficits are not inherently harmful, I agree. But when the foreign countries are nationalizing their products and having an unfair competitive edge within our domestic markets.  Then those trade deficits are eating into production we would have had if those foreign companies and countries played fair. The trade deficit should come from the natural forces of they have something we need more of, where we cannot product enough domestically. Not rampantly shutting down our industries through price manipulation (I know I need to explain this in detail but trying to be brief). They are undercutting us because of the cheaper labor, materials and resources they have being marshalled in some cases at a nationalistic level and we face more challenging barriers to entry than we impose on them.  For example, Google must hand over all their data and servers to be wholly serviced by a domestic entity. While overseas software firms can operate here in the U.S. with their data servers and operators being any country or entity they wish.\n\n2. U.S. investment outflows are usually U.S. businesses building up product and service creation overseas to ship back here. We build call centers, manufacturing plants, and hire knowledge workers and engineers in other countries, then ship those products back here.  The opposite is foreign native companies sell their products here in the U.S. with very little incentive to build any infrastructure here except a distribution center, unless tariffs or tax incentives, like the USMCA incentivised car makers to open plants here.  These outflow are the most costly. These foreign entities then reinvest those U.S. dollars back into the U.S. but where they go are into our real estate and stock markets and treasury bonds, aggressively increasing the prices of these items for americans and they reap the benefits of the value increases. We help fund the world to buy up our own assets and then earn a huge return on them in our own markets. Our markets are almost a zero sum game, when they win, someone here has to lose.\n\n3. There will likely always be a trade deficit and that's not going away. But with a reduced trade deficit there are still many ways countries can keep enough USD in reserve.  First they can just outright purchase the USD. They can also be receiving excess USD when they run trade surpluses against other foreign countries as they are also getting paid in USD.  All these countries WANT to keep USD because they would rather keep one reserve currency for all their foreign transactions rather than keeping reserves of many currencies depending on the country they are trading with. THIS is what keeps us our reserve status and likely if we can keep the dollar stable (yes it's going down now but its going down from too strong of a position) they cannot switch to another currency. No other economic zone or union can support and defend this international reserve status the same way we can, primarily due to our overpowered military."", 'Jobs, Economy & Booming stock markets weren’t enough', '1. US trade deficits largely are organic, maybe with the exception of China. It’s not like other countries have much larger barriers than the US. In case of Canada and Mexico, there is a negotiated deal ensuring this, which both sides agreed to.\n\n2. What I’m talking about is investment flowing in. The US has a low savings rate and a lot of innovative buisnesses in need of capital. So it takes investments from abroad (much more that it invests abroad)\n\n> our markets are almost a zero sum game\n\nThat’s far from the truth, especially in the US - a lot of value is generated in the US economy and the foreign investment helps with that.\n\n3. When tariffs take effect and limit imports, the price of dollar will most likely go up (because of lower supply), and make importing from the US less profitable. That alone will hit US exports, without even considering retaliation tariffs. Trade overall will scale down (although relative trade deficit won’t change much) and foreign investments with it, cutting off US companies from their source of capital injection.\n\n> They can outright purchase USD\n\nFor what? It’s not like US banks need huge amounts of foreign currency. Right now they buy it for products (that the US does need).']"

So, if the US trade deficit with CountryX is $100B and the imports from CountryX are $200B the tariff is 50% by dividing the trade deficit by the imports.  If the US is running a trade *surplus* with CountryX, 10% tariff anyhow, so it is in part, a tax.    \n\nI see *economic suspicion* of the approach being flawed in that it is overly simplistic by not taking into account why the trade deficit is occurring.   \n\nWe'll see what the economists around the world have to say about this one.   \n\nWith a two-party system, it appears that being confined to two choices, we were stuck with dumb and dumber.  The lack of runoffs and ranked voting, etc results in us getting mediocre leadership, with the economic results self-apparent.   \n\nBiden's inflation causing oversized stimulus is in the books.

This would include checks to insure it\'s not contraband, is safe to transport, and all fees and taxes are paid. \n\nSo unless there are exemptions to tariffs the Chinese and South Korean components would have a tariff paid by the board maker in Taiwan, adding that to the cost of materials. That maker would assemble the board with those and local components and ship to another country where the board will have taxes paid and in this case the tax on the components is paid again as part of the value basis for the tax on the board. In the case of a complete system components from all over the world are assembled for shipment for a third country and tax paid on the assembled system which will include taxing some components a third time. All of this is handled by the companies that import the items into a country but at the end of the process of course the cost of manufacturing and shipping includes all that in the cost of goods that is then marked up when presented to you at the point of sale. \n\nUnless you import stuff yourself you don\'t do any of this work, or chase down separate fees from all the different countries.']"

The USA has laws on the books that can NEVER be reversed like the ""Chicken Tax"" which is a 25% tax on all imported half ton trucks to fund the Korean War. The Korean War ended 70 years ago, but we still have the regulations don\'t we? See the Chinese could just by fiat stop that tomorrow. The USA cannot, nor ever reverse it as all taxes and tariffs in the Western world are for the life of nation until collapse or Civil War. Elon even said as much.\n\nAlthough they are no longer Communists in that they don\'t own the industries the same as they used to, but instead require you hire a party member at each industry as a ""minder"", but that minder just sits there and reports to the party and collects a check. They don\'t pass any extreme regulations or taxes on industry over there right now. As a matter of fact, they have gone full Honk Kong, full Free Market Capitalism declaring 21 port cities ""Duty Free"". They don\'t have the long-shoreman\'s union there to stop the imports and exports until you grease their hands to unload the ships. We are hampered by a ton of Cronyism now and as we know, it will sink your nation. Just ask the USSR about that one?\n\nThe USA cannot match that as we can never go back to total Free Market Capitalism. We have to many people now that are to dependent on welfare from the other people in the country still working. Remember, Argentina before its collapse had a full half of their nation getting a welfare check not working. Everyone gets fat and happy and just sits around and gets enough for food and housing and thats where we are headed.

Is what trump trying to do is be communist? Can someone explain how other constructs are applicable to what he's doing? Dictating?,2025-04-04 05:23:09,"[""Trump just does stuff and hopes it would work, there is no other logic and he doesn't have a plan. Stop overthinking it."", 'The USA would technically be a ""Fascist"" nation, similar to that of WW2 Germany or Italy. Fascism is the ""collusion of government and industry"". We could even give it a new name like ""Fascist Democracy"" or ""Fascism Light"" as at a more local level people own their own shops, just like the Germans did, but the big stuff is Cronied in. The Germans called it Socialism and fought with the Communists in the USSR over what that meant. It differs from true Socialism is that the government does not directly own the industries, just ""coddles"" them and makes laws to lock them into Monopolies. No monopoly can exist without government making laws making it so. The Free Market would destroy this arrangement quite quickly.\n\nToday in the USA we call it Cronyism or ""Crony Capitalism"". The way it works is through Regulatory Capture, industry uses government and in turn vice versa to monopolize specific industries. This is done through tariffs, regulations that lock out entry industries coming into an established industry with dominant people already controlling the playing field with Federal regulations, or just flat out locking out industries like Biden when he declared all Chinese cars illegal in the USA simply by saying the software used was spying on Americans allowing him to use National Security laws which are similar to Martial Laws really. This goes on and on. For instance, the broom industry in the USA has a 300% tariff to protect them. The auto industry, well that can be anywhere from zero to 100% depending on whether or not they approve of what cars Americans can own at any time. The Medical industry and the education business are the most extreme versions of this, whereas Medical is super Crony, locking out low cost medical devices from people. We know this because we don\'t see MRI\'s in people homes for instance, otherwise we would all just go lay down in one and get a scan for free, send it off to a doctor and you could do this every week, totally discovering so much cancer and getting it early. Instead we have Hospital Districts which by law limit the amount of ""scan equipment"" per sq mile of city space, not making this up. The public education industry is in fact probably the most extreme version of it, going full Socialism there, whereas the government actually owns the schools and everyone gets the exact same education unless you can afford private. We have for instance a 25% tariff on 1/2 ton pickup trucks called the ""Chicken Tax"" to fund the Korean War, basically locking out all foreign half ton trucks for 70+ yrs now, and thats why there isn\'t any. This goes on and on and on.\n\nWhat we know is that extreme regulations on industry like the USA has leads to very high prices on certain goods like cars and medical stuff and what it really is doing is just transferring the wealth of the nation over to the cronies. This is exactly why the Medical industry eats up like a 1/3 of the nations wealth.\n\nCompare this to the TV industry. Big huge big screens now are so affordable people are stacking up the old TV\'s in their homes. Cannot even give them away. So an item that once cost the cost of a car, now is less than $1000, same with computers. Everyone has old ones that still work just laying around. How many old cars or MRI machines you see laying around that are still working? Thats the difference between Crony industries vs free market industries. There are NO tariffs on computers or TVs, and very little to no regulations other than standards.\n\nNow you ask, what does the Politicians get, well, they get 10%, just like in the emails. If these industries don\'t ""share the loot"" with the politicians, well then they will find someone to take your place. Its a ""quid-pro-quo"" arrangement.\n\nThis happens in all countries, and no one is immune. It just depends on to what degree and how sustainable it is in the long run, and it runs for the life of most governments because the arrangement is set in law, and laws are very difficult to overturn so therefore runs the life of the nation until said nation collapses, think of the USSR here. I have never seen Cronyism reversed without a Civil War or total economic collapse.']"

More and more beneficial for corporations and less and less for the people. All other countries, including EU meanwhile had and implemented new tariffs. So that part of Trump's narrative is actually true. But what will happen with US tariffs is completely different story.

By suddenly raising and lowering tariffs by large amounts (currently 50% in some cases, and there’s no reason why he can’t go higher to make a point), he can attack companies’ respective weak points and sabotage their operations, making them consistently less competitive. He can also pair this with reduced tariffs that will make their rivals MORE competitive., and can thus pit them against one another, always rewarding the most compliant and punishing the least complaint.\n\nBecause most companies literately legally exist to maximize profits, this will eventually force them to either acquiesce to his demands (no matter how extreme, eg.

Easy to understand explanation of Trump's reciprocal tariffs,2025-04-04 02:24:06,"['They added Greek letters and subscripts to make it look intelligent but it’s just (exports to US - imports from US) divided by (exports to US)', ""I can fix this very easy for you,  Trump is betting the farm that other countries will bend the knee.   That some corporations will soak up some of the impact and/or, as you said - build factories in America.  \n\n1) The majority of countries will not bend the knee and will respond with their own tariffs, and rightly so\n\n2) The majority of corporations will not soak up some of the cost, they will pass the vast majority onto consumers and hence, why the stock markets are in free fall\n\n3) Regardless, this will not restore factories in America - it will make countries doing business with America seek different trade partners, thus weakening US economically\n\nOutcome, this is a stupid, literal stupid move by Trump that reeks of nationalism disguised as a hidden tax on the consumers which is almost no doubt to pay for the tax breaks he's about to give to the rich, because he knows he can't attack social benefits without triggering a civil war."", 'Thank you so much for this explanation. I wish it would have gotten more traction. Personally, I needed help understanding the constants.\n\nI think the constants really demonstrate how this is a formula *designed* to drive down demand for imports in the US. (However, it also happens to encourage other countries to buy American, the way they\'re employing it.) The formula calculates ""what will it take to get Americans to buy less of this import."" I would say there are two issues with how they are employing it.\n\n1. Using the same constant values for all countries and all types of products seems wrong. I don\'t know how they calculated those numbers, but I would guess they would turn out to be either too high or too low for different types of products.\n2. Like you said, trying to eliminate a trade deficit isn\'t always a good idea, especially if you\'re trying to do it quickly. For example, maybe we want cheap diamonds from Lesotho ([see this CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-fake-tariff-rates-1.7501604)), and maybe Lesotho could use our money. Lesotho gets to grow their wealth and industry, and we get diamonds. It\'s not a major threat to us if Lesotho can increase their QOL and standing in the world. If there\'s now a tariff on those diamonds, and we can\'t find them on our own soil, then Americans just can\'t afford diamonds now, and Lesotho can\'t sell their diamonds either. (I\'m setting aside any argument over the degree to which we are unfairly exploiting these countries, for now.)\n\nI kind of wonder if this is a real formula with a history of legitimate use, or if it\'s something that was newly invented by people who only half-know what they\'re doing. So far, the quotes from experts in the mainstream news are pointing towards the latter.', 'This isn\'t hard to understand at all. Trump is attempting to FORCE ""free trade"". He is directly putting tariffs on those who have tariffs on us. Thats all you have to know. He will remove the tariffs if you remove your tariffs. That what Canada is negotiating for right now with Trump and its already having results. Canada is now removing Inter-commerce taxes on their own provinces and removing the additional taxes on imported energy to the USA.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/business/tariffs-canada-trump/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/business/tariffs-canada-trump/index.html)', 'Greek symbols are very common in mathematics', 'This is confusing to me (not avidly into economics)the only way countries could* bend the knee would be to lower the prices by whatever percentage to mean that including the tariff the price remains the same, right? \n\nI thought the consensus was that the costs are born by the importer not the exporting country - and tarrifs just disincentivise purchasing from said country.', 'in my opinion, there will be some producers, who will gladly open factories in the USA if they can get access to a lucrative US market. If this is a power play to get loads of concessions from large importing countries - it might actually work. Otherwise I think blanket and sudden tariffs like that are akin to a consumption tax of 30% on US consumers, which will have serious consequences on domestic demand, and can easily lead to a major depression, possibly even worldwide.', 'Definitely not a a ""real formula"", all the economists are somewhat in shock at the audacity. The formula is trying to to make imports so expensive, that the demand for them will decrease to the point where American Imports = American Exports. The constants are dubious, they don\'t take into account many factors, and especially the time factor of having to start replacing imports with domestic production. If it is used as a power play, where the largest importers will be induced to invest in the USA and will get a preferential treatment - it might work for some industries (relatively low labor intensity like automotive, chips, etc.). For other things, like clothing - I am not sure if the US wages can make it attractive to open a sweat shop here even with 40% tariffs. \n\nBut there are many more problems with the constants. Price elasticity of demand is assumed to be constant, but in practice it is more likely that it is a changing value, depending on the price. Once tariffs are introduced, and production shifts (let\'s say to Australia), the price elasticities of a particular country will change due to alternatives. This is too rough of a calculation, and given that the end result is a 1, it\'s probably an inside joke. The 0.25 constant also depends greatly on a tariff size. If your margin is 50%, then you probably can live with a 25% margin, beyond that you will pass on the tariff to the consumer. If your margin is 10%, you will pass on most of the tariff to the consumer and will probably seek a cheaper base for your production. \n\nThe main problem seems to be that the tariffs cover everything without any filter whatsoever. If the US wants to rebuild its auto industry, it should probably make inputs less expensive, not more expensive. Therefore it still then makes sense to manufacture the car outside of the USA, because even if you take the time and expense of building a car in the US, it won\'t be cheaper, because most of your spare details will still be expensive imports. They might come up with some waivers, but it seems the next 1-2 years might get messy. A better way might have been by introducing tariffs for goods that have an American alternative or can at least in theory be produced in the US.\n\nSomewhat understanding how Trump thinks, this could actually end up as a big win for China. If they can commit a couple of trillion of investment in the USA over the next four years for waiving tariffs, they could end up with a monopoly over the US imports, essentially.', 'Funny thing is, they have set the minimum tarif to 10% (except for Russia and North Korea, go figure).\n\nIf the goal was to balance the trade deficit by tying tarifs to the deficit, setting a bottom of 10% means that there is no reason to go below a 10% trade deficit for any country.\n\nIn any case it is utter nonsense.', "">He is directly putting tariffs on those who have tariffs on us.\n\nBut he isn't. The core problem is that they pulled an equation out of their a** in which tariffs aren't even relevant -  a country with no tariffs at all could have a huge trade imbalance and would get a huge tariff applied."", ""I don't think you understand what Trump's reciprocal tariffs mean.

The president says tariffs are needed to close America’s trade deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet as any of the president’s economists could have told him, this overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than their country invests\u2009—\u2009and, crucially, this long-running reality has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with every trading partner individually is bonkers\u2009—\u2009like suggesting that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that each of its suppliers is also a customer.\n\nAnd Mr Trump’s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a country’s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes America’s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported from each country and halves it\u2009—\u2009which is almost as random as taxing you on the number of vowels in your name.', ""Yes.

Transactions that convert other currencies to dollars accrue fees that are paid to US banks.  The US controlled the World Bank and the IMF and through these organizations implemented neocolonialism around the world which force many countries to export their raw materials and plantation crops to the US at reduced prices impoverishing those countries for the benefit of the American Oligarchy.  After WWII, the Oligarchy had to ""play nice"" with the Average American or worry about the threat of communism.  So ""Mr. Everyman"" was bought off and lured into complacency.

Which means less people are needed to sell and ship them. You see, Americans don't just make things, we import and sell them too. So where do those less people shop? They don't, so more less things are sold in a vicious cycle until you too are one of them. \n\nWe did this before.

Up until Democracy and Human Rights and limitations placed on government, governments of any kind would simple steal everything from everyone. The King himself claimed that all the deer were his deer, even in your yard, so you cannot hunt without his permission.\n\nHumans got sick of being oppressed so came up with limits on Government. What this means is the government that governs the best , governs the least. No government has ever, never ever, ""taxed its way into prosperity"". We will be the most prosperous with the least amount of taxes and regulations. Taxes and regulations were put in place to collect money originally to pay for wars. WW1, thats the income tax. WW2, that the automatic deductions of the money from your check before you get it, both of these create a drag on business and the economy by sucking monies away from the people. Pickup trucks today are 25% higher priced because of the Chicken Tax, and that also stayed permanent and was originally put in place to fund the Korean War.\n\nSo what does this mean. This means that any wars fought by the USA will come with a tax increase. The money was never allocated to help the people, it was allocated to win wars. Now once the wars were over, they then used the money in some cases for a good thing, like Ike using the money they get now for WW2 to build the National Highway system, however, though , most of the time the money goes ""poof"" like you are seeing with DOGE uncovering $150 billion now, within a month that was going to people who didn\'t even have an SS number or were 11 years old, stuff like that.\n\nSo all you have to know is that the Capitalist create the most wealth and non-Capitalist are 100% dependent on Capitalist to feed them.

Trump’s Tariffs Are Designed to Backfire,2025-04-04 00:01:12,"['Rogé Karma: “According to President Donald Trump, April 2, 2025—the day he unveiled his executive order implementing global tariffs—will be remembered as a turning point in American history. He might be right. Unfortunately, April 2 is more likely to be remembered as a fiasco—alongside October 24, 1929 (the stock-market crash that kicked off the Great Depression), and September 15, 2008 (the collapse of Lehman Brothers)—than as the beginning of a new era of American prosperity. [https://theatln.tc/q8QQubWe](https://theatln.tc/q8QQubWe)\xa0\n\n“The stated rationale behind Trump’s new ‘reciprocal tariffs’ has a more coherent internal logic than Trump’s previous tariff maneuvers. (*Stated*, as we will see, is the key word.) The idea is that other countries have unfairly advantaged their own industries at the expense of America’s, both through tariffs and through methods such as currency manipulation and subsidies to domestic firms. To solve the problem, the U.S. will now tax imports from nearly every country on the planet, supposedly in proportion to the barriers that those countries place on American goods.\n\n“The goal, according to senior administration officials, is to pressure other countries into removing their trade barriers, at which point the U.S. will drop its own … Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has even argued that many of the new tariffs won’t ever need to go into effect, because other countries will be so quick to comply. In this telling, Trump’s reciprocal measures represent the tariff to end all tariffs, paving the road to a system of genuinely free trade and a return to American industrial dominance.\xa0\n\n“But the logical consistency, such as it is, is only internal. When the new tariffs come into contact with external reality, they are likely to produce the exact opposite of the intended outcome.\n\n“Most obviously, the tariffs don’t appear to be based on actual trade barriers, which undermines their entire justification. Contrary to White House messaging, the formula for determining the new rates turns out to have been based simply on the dollar value of goods the U.S. imports from a given country relative to how much it exports. The administration took the difference between the two numbers, divided it by each country’s total exports, then divided that total in half, and slapped an import tax on countries at that rate. The theoretically reciprocal tariffs are not, in fact, reciprocal.\n\n“The result is that there is no clear or obvious path that countries could take to get those tariffs removed even if they wanted to. Countries can remove all of their trade restrictions and still run a trade surplus. South Korea, Mexico, and Canada, for example, export more to us than they import from us despite imposing virtually no trade barriers.”\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/q8QQubWe](https://theatln.tc/q8QQubWe)\xa0', 'It’s simply the nation’s trade deficit with us divided by the nation’s exports to us.  \n  \nYes.

That's if it is exactly the right type of steel - the types that can be made with those mills that have the unused capacity, and tat they can staff those plants with unemployment as low as it is.\n\nThen we move on to aluminum. It's electricity-intensive, and we import a huge amount of what we use from Canada, which can produce it far more inexpensively than the US because they have an abundance of low-cost electricity. I think that is what trade is about - Canada makes things they are good at making and we make what we are good at making and ship that to Canada. Our trade deficit with Canada is a bit above $60-million, not the $200-million that Trump keeps bringing up, and if you take the energy Canada exports to the US out the equation, they actually buy more from the US than they export.\n\nSo right now, we can wait around 5-10 years to see if the steel and aluminum companies invest the tens of billions needed to start new plants and pay higher prices in the meantime for imported metals (why would these companies do that, considering Trump will be out of office or perhaps may have passed on in 4 years, unless Trump becomes King, at which point, I doubt if they'll invest in an authoritarian-state?).\n\nIn the meantime, the uncertainty and economic malaise that we are seeing right now looks like it will cost me a $70,000 consulting project which I need to pay off debt, pay an employee and pay the bills going forward.\n\nI feel liberated."", 'At some point, consumers stop paying.

Those are individual traditional economic forces. Tariffs can put things into a tailspin if there are more retaliatory tariffs but in case you haven\'t noticed, America has been getting tariffed and taxed abroad (they add an actual tax to American goods sold in that country) by foreign govts at egregious rates.  The deficit trade country always wins a trade war. They need us to buy their products otherwise the foreign economies that depend on us buying their products will shrink. Their only option is to sell to foreign countries that cannot pay what we paid or buy as much as we bought.  Their economies will shrink unless we continue buying their products, so even if their products get more expensive here, we are still their best option.\n\nThey weren\'t buying our products in the first place because of the egregious tariffs they have had on our products, but the falling dollar can offset that by reducing the cost of American products in relationship to the currency value.  The dollar has grown 50% stronger in relative strength to foreign currencies in the last 3 years. Even if it gets more expensive to produce here because tariffs increase the cost of raw materials, if the dollar comes down in value it will effectively reduce the cost foreign countries pay for our goods in their own currency.\n\nAn example of how the falling dollar helps countries buy more American products:\n\nLet\'s say before these tariffs it took $10 of raw materials to build a product and we sold it at $100 per unit, and In Japan they were paying 160 yen because dollar exchange rate was 1:1.6 (1 dollar equivalent to 160 yen)\n\nThen tariffs come and the cost of materials is now $20 and we sell at $110 per unit.  However the dollar also comes down by 25% relative to the Yen.  That means an exchange rate of 1:1.2 (1 dollar equivalent to 120 yen), then the Japanese only need to pay 132 yen for that ""more expensive"" product.\n\nThe negative effects of the dollar coming down? When you travel to Japan things will be 25% more expensive than before, but we were enjoying a steep 60% discounts on Japanese goods for the past 2 years anyways so you\'ll still get a discount, but not at the same rate.  This also goes for raw materials.\n\nAlso to note, all these countries WANT the dollar to remain strong so their products remain cheaper here while our products are overpriced in their home countries. They may even be manipulating their currencies to do this.\n\nGo and read up before you come back thinking this is also some ""magical bag"" explanation.\n\nI\'ll also have no more explanations for you or people who have no desire to actually understand these fundamental ideas and just want fodder for your rhetoric.', ""Well...he's stated he wants to be self sufficient, and to bring back jobs to America, whether this happens the way he envisions it is something completely different. It is true America's manufacturing is still strong (how can it not be, when you have so much land and resources?), but he wants it to be greater. Whether he manages to do this and what the impacts will be to the dollar in the long term is pretty hard to gauge just off a graph. On top of this, America has never been a good case study for studying economics, what works for her doesn't necessarily work for others in many cases."", 'Bet on what?

Additionally the excessively strong dollar has so much headroom to come down and offset their policies while they have no headroom except to bankrupt their currency if they try to go lower.\n\nAs an analogy to interest rates, their currency is basically sitting at an equivalent of 0% interest rates.

What’s the real motivation behind Trump’s tariffs?

Of course they will need to calculate if price increases will drive down demand and reduce profits more than just eating tariffs. To your point same argument can be made for wages and taxes.

Help me understand why Trump is tanking our economy and making enemies of our trading partners!,2025-04-03 11:08:17,"[""A Facebook post(from Oregon’s Bay Area) explained his fascination with tariffs! Here’s their post: “We finally have our answer. After years of vague slogans and red hats, Donald Trump has revealed exactly when he believes America was great: 1789. Yes, the year George Washington became president. The year the U.S. Constitution took effect. The year “we the people” meant wealthy white landowners, while women, Black people, Indigenous peoples, and the working class were denied basic rights, voices, or dignity. That’s the America he wants to bring back, not just in spirit, but in economic policy.\n\nIn what may go down as the most chaotic and economically incoherent press conference in modern history, Trump took to the White House Rose Garden to announce sweeping new tariffs that immediately sent markets into a tailspin. The plan? A blanket 10 percent baseline tariff on all countries, effective April 5, with even steeper “reciprocal” tariffs for specific countries based on whatever Trump perceives as “cheating.” What the market expected was a moderate, maybe even symbolic gesture. What it got was Trump doing economic cosplay with a magic marker and a flimsy chart, channeling the ghosts of mercantilism and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act like they’re founding fathers.\n\nWall Street reacted like a cat thrown into a bathtub. Dow futures plummeted more than 1,000 points. The S&P 500 dropped 3.6 percent. The Nasdaq? Down 4.5 percent. This wasn’t a mild correction, it was an after-hours crash. Shares of major multinationals like Nike and Apple each fell around 7 percent. Retailers that rely on imports got obliterated: Five Below cratered 14 percent, Dollar Tree fell 11, and Gap dropped 8.5. Even tech giants weren’t spared, with Nvidia shedding 5 percent and Tesla down 7, ironic, considering Trump’s awkward love-hate tango with Musk.\n\nThe administration tried to clarify, but only made things worse. According to a White House follow-up, countries like China could now face an effective 54 percent tariff rate once you add Trump’s new “reciprocal” logic to existing penalties. Traders had hoped for a capped rate of 10 to 20 percent across the board. Instead, they got a fever dream of vengeance tariffs, delivered like a kindergarten show-and-tell, complete with oversized charts and half-formed math.\n\nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, didn’t mince words. “What was delivered was as haphazard as anything this administration has done to date,” he told CNBC. “The level of complication on top of the ultimate level of new tariffs is worse than had been feared and not yet priced into the market.” Larry Tentarelli of the Blue Chip Trend Report echoed that if Trump had simply stuck to the 10 percent, markets might have gone up. But Trump can’t help himself. He had to go big, chaotic, and wildly unpredictable.\n\nThen came the history lesson. Trump declared, with his usual smug certainty, that from 1789 to 1913, the United States was the wealthiest it’s ever been, purely because of tariffs. According to him, we were collecting so much money so fast that the government didn’t know what to do with it. Of course, he left out the part where most Americans lived in poverty, where wealth was concentrated in a few monopolists' hands, and where child labor and 14-hour workdays were the norm. The “wealth” he refers to was largely theoretical for the average citizen and absolutely real for the Carnegies, the Rockefellers, and other Robber Barons of the Gilded Age. Tariffs weren’t some magic goose laying golden eggs, they were regressive taxes that hit working people hardest, all while padding the profits of a corrupt elite. Sound familiar?\n\nIn the same breath, Trump launched a bizarre tirade against Canada, yes, Canada. Our closest ally, trading partner, and the only country that says “sorry” when we mess up. He claimed the U.S. subsidizes Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year, and that it’s time for them to fend for themselves. Canadian officials, not surprisingly, are now organizing boycotts of U.S. goods and tourism. That’s what you get when you treat allies like enemies and think you’re negotiating a Manhattan real estate deal instead of running global trade.\n\nAs Trump spun his globetrotting list of economic enemies, from Vietnam to Taiwan to the European Union, he declared this moment “Liberation Day.” Liberation Day!?! He actually said that years from now, we’ll all look back on this press conference as the day we got “so rich, so fast.” You know who else promises riches if you just believe hard enough? Cult leaders.\n\nAnd while the markets reeled and global confidence in American leadership sank, Trump rambled about plastic Easter eggs. You read that right. Midway through the economic collapse, he paused to thank someone named Brooke for ensuring there’d be enough plastic eggs for Easter. He praised the term “groceries” as a beautiful, old-fashioned word. These are the thoughts swirling around in the mind of the man who just launched a global trade war.\n\nAnd just when you thought it couldn’t get more absurd, Trump forgot to sign the executive order he had spent the entire press conference hyping. An aide had to remind him. He ambled back, scribbled his name, then wandered off again, apparently satisfied that he’d just rescued the economy by detonating a stick of dynamite under it.\n\nThis is economic sabotage. Whether through malice or incompetence or, more likely, both Trump is isolating the United States on the world stage, tanking the markets, worsening inflation, and burdening working families with the cost of his 18th-century cosplay. These aren’t policies. They’re performance art. And the rest of us are footing the bill.\n\nHistory won’t remember this as Liberation Day. It will remember it as the day America’s last shreds of economic sanity were tossed into a bonfire of delusion, lit by a man who thinks tariffs are magic beans and “groceries” is a fancy word for freedom.”"", ""This is a Dump & Pump scheme.

In the end, money is consolidated even further into the very top and everyone else gets screwed. \n\nWith Trump it's all about making more money for he and his friends.

So an enormous tax hike on the American people, the largest in the history of the country, larger than the increases to pay off war debt from the World Wars.\n\nAnd what will that trigger?

However, instead of Volcker's strategy of aggressively raising the interest rates to make everything more expensive to ease spending with the caveat that it could trigger a recession. \n\nThey are in essence raising the cost of everything by increasing taxes through tariff.

He was toxic and all the NY banks didn’t want to touch him. Then comes Deutsche Bank from the blue loaning him 200+ million. This bank would get in trouble years later for money laundering for Russian oligarchs. So they were using him to laundry money, and he understood that. He accepted that he was bought and paid for.

Free trade is largely seen as a positive for many business owners but a huge negative for working class people. A lot of small cities and towns in America have been really struggling since manufacturing fled the US, and tariffs are seen as a way to bring back domestic manufacturing. This explains why these communities tend to be rabidly pro-Trump. It is a matter of survival \n2. The tax revenue collected from tariffs can remove the need for federal income taxes. Taxing income is seen as a tax on productivity, which is generally bad\n3. Free trade makes America reliant on the global supply chain, which COVID showed is weak to sudden shocks. Domestic production is seen as more reliable. This might be doubly true if America intends to engage in warfare that would disrupt this supply chain e.g. war with China\n4. Tariffs can be used as a bargaining chip.

What the hells is this supposed to do, really.', 'Based on OpenAI o1 Model \n\nBelow is a brief fact‐check using recent official U.S. trade data (from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau) to see whether the figures in that table are accurate. The table seems to claim that for many countries, the ratio\n\n(U.S. trade deficit with a country) ÷ (U.S. imports from that country)\n\nis very high (e.g., 80%–90%). In reality, for most major U.S. trading partners, that ratio is often noticeably lower than the table suggests—except in a few cases (notably Vietnam). Let’s look at some 2022 data, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Vietnam\n\t•\tImports from Vietnam (2022): $127.5\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to Vietnam (2022): $11.9\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $127.5\u202fbillion – $11.9\u202fbillion = $115.6\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $115.6\u202fb / $127.5\u202fb ≈ 90.7%\n\nConclusion: The table’s Vietnam line (≈\u202f90%) actually does match up pretty closely with the official 2022 data.\n\n⸻\n\n2. China\n\t•\tImports from China (2022): $537.1\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to China (2022): $153.8\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $537.1\u202fb – $153.8\u202fb = $383.3\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $383.3\u202fb / $537.1\u202fb ≈ 71%\n\nConclusion: The table claims something around 80–90% for China, but in reality it is closer to 70–72%. That’s significantly different from “near 90%.”\n\n⸻\n\n3. European Union (as a whole)\n\t•\tImports from EU (2022): $573.3\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to EU (2022): $352.2\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $573.3\u202fb – $352.2\u202fb = $221.1\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $221.1\u202fb / $573.3\u202fb ≈ 39%\n\nConclusion: The table seems to suggest a much higher ratio (e.g., ~87%). Actual data is closer to 39%.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Taiwan\n\t•\tImports from Taiwan (2022): $78.7\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to Taiwan (2022): $39.1\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $78.7\u202fb – $39.1\u202fb = $39.6\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $39.6\u202fb / $78.7\u202fb ≈ 50%\n\nConclusion: If the table says ~79%, that’s off. Official data suggests around 50%.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Japan\n\t•\tImports from Japan (2022): $150.4\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to Japan (2022): $80.7\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $150.4\u202fb – $80.7\u202fb = $69.7\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $69.7\u202fb / $150.4\u202fb ≈ 46%\n\nConclusion: If the table implies something higher (e.g., ~70%), that’s not accurate.\n\n⸻\n\n6. Mexico\n\t•\tImports from Mexico (2022): $454.9\u202fbillion\n\t•\tExports to Mexico (2022): $324.4\u202fbillion\n\t•\tTrade deficit: $454.9\u202fb – $324.4\u202fb = $130.5\u202fbillion\n\t•\tDeficit ÷ Imports: $130.5\u202fb / $454.9\u202fb ≈ 29%\n\nConclusion: Tables that put Mexico at a 50% or higher ratio would be off.\n\n⸻\n\nOverall Verdict\n\t•\tVietnam does indeed have a very high “deficit vs. imports” ratio—around 90%—and the table’s figure for Vietnam looks about right.\n\t•\tHowever, for many other countries (China, EU, Taiwan, Japan, etc.), the table’s percentages are significantly higher than what official data shows.\n\nIn other words, the table is not broadly accurate.

I know they talk about bringing manufacturing back, but do we really want that?  There\'s a reason we exported all that to other places.  Now we want to compete with overseas sweatshops?  I doubt it.  Americans will not enjoy working harder for less pay.\n\nA trade deficit isn\'t a bad thing just because the word ""deficit"" sounds scary.  We get cheap crap we want from other places.  Their exploitation and environmental destruction are costs we don\'t have to bear (except in the sense the whole world is going to suffer from global warming).

He talked about how there are two types of bargaining: distributive and integrative.\n\nIntegrative is basically when two sides aren\'t entirely opposed and can reach an agreement that benefits both sides. These can be complex deals, where on side gives more in one area to receive more in another area. Neither side really ""wins"" or ""loses"".\n\nThe other type, distributive, is more singular and absolute. In this, one side comes away with the better deal. His example was dividing up a pie; If you want to ""win"", you come away with more of the pie than the other guy.\n\nHe pointed out how Trump is only capable of distributive bargaining. He always has to ""win"". He has no ability to give and take.\n\nAnd these tariffs being the trade balance ratios shows exactly that.

It is simply America exploiting cheap labour. \nThe US method of ""calculating"" the tariff rates is so obviously and deliberately wrong that there must be an alternative agenda at play.\nAnd some countries such as the UK actually have a negative trade balance with the US but conveniently the tariff ""methodology"" is put aside and the UK is subject to 10%.\nAmerica has somehow elected a person who is addicted to power and influence and who wants to destroy the world order for reasons  known only to himself.

(Some sources show slightly different 2023 figures, e.g., $2.76B or $2.98B SL exports to US, $507M or $516M US exports to SL, but the ratios remain similar).\n    *   **Calculation:** Your calculation method (`1 - [US Exports / Imports]`) accurately produces the alleged ""tariff"" numbers based on this trade data:\n        *   **Cambodia:** $321.6M / $12.7B ≈ 0.0253 (2.53%). So, 1 - 0.0253 ≈ 0.9747 or **~97%**.\n        *   **Vietnam:** $13.1B / $136.6B ≈ 0.0959 (9.59%). So, 1 - 0.0959 ≈ 0.9041 or **~90%**.\n        *   **Sri Lanka:** $368.2M / $3.0B ≈ 0.1227 (12.27%). So, 1 - 0.1227 ≈ 0.8773 or **~88%**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Your hypothesis that these specific numbers (97%, 90%, 88%) are derived directly from the inverse of the US trade balance ratio with these countries is mathematically correct based on recent trade data.\n\n2.  **Are these numbers ""Tariffs""?**\n    *   **Definition:** No, these numbers do not represent actual tariffs. Tariffs are taxes imposed by a government on imported goods. They are set percentages applied to the value of specific goods (ad valorem) or fixed amounts per unit (specific duties).\n    *   **Trade Balance:** The calculation you identified is a measure of the *trade imbalance* expressed as a percentage. It reflects how much more (in percentage terms) the US imports from these countries than it exports to them.\n    *   **Actual Tariffs:**\n        *   **Cambodia:** Actual applied tariffs are much lower. One older USTR source cited an average applied rate of 11.7%, with the highest rate at 35% on specific goods. World Bank data suggests a weighted mean applied tariff for primary products of 6.44% in 2022. Cambodia also has a standard 10% VAT on imports.\n        *   **Vietnam:** Vietnam\'s trade-weighted average MFN tariff is around 5.1%. Many US exports face tariffs of 15% or less. Vietnam recently *cut* import taxes on various US goods (like wood products to 0%, frozen chicken thighs to 15%, cars reduced but still high) explicitly to address the trade imbalance.\n        *   **Sri Lanka:** Sri Lanka has historically had high and complex import duties, sometimes exceeding 100% effectively on certain goods (like vehicles). However, average weighted mean applied tariff rates reported by the World Bank were around 4.36% in 2021, though they were higher previously (13.3% in 2019). There are also additional levies like VAT.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The numbers 97%, 90%, and 88% are vastly different from actual tariff rates applied by these countries. Your assertion that these numbers don\'t reflect real tariffs is correct.\n\n3.  **Source of the ""Tariff"" Claims:**\n    *   Recent news articles (April 2-3, 2025) confirm that the Trump administration announced new ""reciprocal tariffs"".\n    *   President Trump explicitly cited these high percentage figures (e.g., 97% for Cambodia, 90% for Vietnam, 88% for Sri Lanka) as the basis for new US tariffs, describing them as the rates/barriers those countries impose on the US.\n    *   The administration announced ""discounted"" reciprocal tariffs based on these figures. For example:\n        *   Cambodia: Claimed 97% barrier, new US tariff set at 49%.\n        *   Vietnam: Claimed 90% barrier, new US tariff set at 46%.\n        *   Sri Lanka: Claimed 88% barrier, new US tariff set at 44%.\n    *   A USTR document mentions that ""Reciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits..."" assuming deficits are caused by foreign barriers.\n    *   Economists and news analyses (like those on Reddit, 9meters, EconomyNext) have pointed out, similar to your conclusion, that these initial high percentages appear derived from trade balance ratios, not actual tariff schedules, calling the methodology flawed or misleading.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Yes, the administration (specifically the Trump administration as of April 2025) *has* cited these high numbers (97%, 90%, 88%) and explicitly linked them to the concept of tariffs/trade barriers imposed *by* these countries, using them as justification for imposing new US tariffs, even if the calculation appears based on trade balance ratios rather than actual foreign tariff rates.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   Your calculation method accurately derives the specific numbers (97%, 90%, 88%) from the US trade balance ratios with Cambodia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka using recent data.\n*   These numbers are *not* representative of the actual tariff rates those countries apply to US goods, which are generally much lower (though sometimes complex, especially in Sri Lanka).\n*   Recent reports confirm the Trump administration cited these high percentages (or numbers very close to them) as representing foreign barriers/tariffs and used them as a basis for implementing new ""reciprocal"" (though discounted) tariffs on goods imported *into* the US from these countries. Your assessment that the administration is calling these figures ""tariffs"" (or equivalent barriers justifying tariffs) is supported by recent events.', 'Sooooo. Help a dummy out.

I’m confused about tariffs,2025-04-03 05:09:57,[]
Is the economy set up so the average person fails?,2025-04-03 05:09:33,"['Is grass green?', 'Capitalism, without regulation or some form of redistribution of wealth, creates mass inequality.  Sure, legally, ANYONE technically has a CHANCE to become wealthy but its the luck of the draw. Not EVERYONE can be wealthy or well.  Not EVERYONE can be a CEO or business owner. People still have to fulfill all the same jobs as before. There still has to be a garbage man, a custodian, a bus driver, a receptionist, etc. It\'s like playing a game of musical chairs. While EVERYONE has ""a chance"" to win at the end, only ONE can. Same with a capitalist society. There HAS to be ""winners"" and ""losers."" It\'s designed that way.  The economy and the organizations that produce goods and services naturally work in a structure like a pyramid.\n\nOnly a few at the top can be the owners or higher ups in each business or company, while the lower you go in that organization, the more people there will be but with less pay. The owner or CEO is at the top (the top 0.1% and gets paid far more than everyone else in the company. Then there\'s a handful of executives who are in the next tier. They make less than the CEO or owner but still get paid far more than everyone else. Then there\'s the mid-level managers and specialized experts (engineers, loan officers, nurses, etc). They make decent money but are not going to be wealthy. These are the middle or upper middle class. Then you get the lower level employees like staff accountants, customer service, etc. And below them, the custodians, servers, bell boys, manual laborers, etc.  These are the poor and working class who make up the bulk of the workers.\n\nSince it\'s capitalism, the natural goal is to make the owners the most money possible. So, the owner of the company, board of directors, and stockholders are the ones who get most of the money while the rest of the employees are just costs to the company and get paid just enough to keep them from quitting and getting hired some where else that might pay more.\n\nSo, yeah, it\'s naturally structured so that a tiny percentage get most of the wealth and it gets less and less for more and more people because they are just labor for the owners.\n\nLike I said above, ANYONE COULD become wealthy or significantly wealthier but it\'s not a guarantee and mostly comes down to luck. For someone else to rise, someone else must go down.  Not everyone can be rich, no matter how hard everyone tries. 90% will lose and HAVE to remain at the bottom. Not everyone can be rich or be a CEO or doctor or lawyer. There\'s simply not enough positions for these higher paying jobs.  All the other, lower paying jobs have to be filled too.\n\nSo, yeah, in a capitalist society with no regulations or distribution of wealth, there will be extreme gaps in wealth where a tiny percentage will be rich and the rest will be middle class or poor.\n\nThat\'s why I strongly advocate for much higher taxes on the wealthy.  Rich people can still be rich but the poor and middle class will no longer be struggling and they can live a good life, like many of the northern European countries. They tax the wealthy and the governments invest in ALL THEIR PEOPLE, not just the already rich and well off.  American is not only the wealthiest country in history but it\'s filthy rich. Unfortunately, most of that wealth is in the hands of only a few.  The US has a  GDP of $40 trillion. That\'s equivalent to $90,000 of goods and products produced per every man, woman, and child or $363,000 for every family of four in America. The US has an estimated $140 trillion in wealth. That\'s equivalent to an average wealth of $450,0000 per every man, woman, and child or $1.7 million per family of four.  \n\nThe US can ABSOLUTELY extinguish all poverty and homelessness in America, provide health care for all Americans, and a healthy lifestyle for all Americans.  We can have ALL that AND have rich people too.  All we have to do is legislate that and increase taxes on the wealthy but political propaganda and powerful, wealthy sources work hard to convince Americans to NOT do that.  You\'ve probably heard all the excuses, ""we need rich people to provide jobs,"" ""rich people will move to another country,"" ""that\'s communism,"" ""that\'s stealing from rich people,"" blah, blah, blah.', ""# NO.

But we never seem to get a sober analysis of that. We just get ""America first"" cheerleading from the Trump supporters and ""We\'re headed for a recession and stagflation"" panic from the opposition.\n\nFor full disclosure, I happen to be a never-Trump centrist, but one of the things that has always bothered me about the GOP is that they\'ve been free trade purists to the detriment of American jobs and wages. If a republican can break that trend, I\'m not opposed to it. Remember what Ross Perot said about NAFTA creating a ""giant sucking sound"" of lost jobs as manufacturing relocated south of the border? Remember the massive tech outsourcing to India and China that we saw, particularly in the 90\'s and early 2000\'s? Remember the wake-up call we got during COVID about being overly dependent on imports, particularly from China? So, although I\'m certainly NOT a fan of Trump\'s antagonizing, bull-in-a-china shop approach to everything he does, I\'m also not inherently opposed to the idea that we need a little protectionism as well as more insourcing, near-sourcing, or friend-sourcing.', 'It’s official.

Makes perfect sense.\n\nTrumps Economist 2: Weren’t you going with a flat rate tariff on all trading partners?\n\nTrump: Yeah I said that but, no, that’s boring. Flat rate—what is that?

Most countries have a trade surplus with us because we buy a ton. Makes sense. And it’ll take me five minutes to make the list.\n\nTrump: Five minutes? That’s perfect. That’s leadership. That’s the kind of efficiency I like. Also—deficient, defic-whatever—it’s a complicated word. That’s why I have you guys. You’re the experts. My deficit guys. Very smart. They say no one understands the deficit like me, but you, you’re second best. Huuge!\n\nTE2: Mr. President, with respect, you can’t just use the deficit like that. Like—Vietnam, for example. We have a big deficit with them, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s unfair.

These simulations also demonstrate that implementation of the USRTA most likely would substantially reduce\nthe U.S. trade deficit while creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. These\nbenefits notwithstanding, however, the U.S. would still face a substantial overall trade deficit and substantial bilateral trade deficits with many of its major\ntrading partners."" \n\n---\nThe part I find most insane in the chapter is that their strategy only discusses 2 possible outcomes. \n\n1.)

A few facts about this: USA and Denmarks and Greenland have an agreement about defence of Greenland. First signed in 1951 between USA and Denmark and confirmed in 2004 with also Greenland signing. The agreement allows US troops in Greenland and at its peak during the cold war there were 15.000 US troops in many air bases, naval bases and radar stations across greenland. However, after the cold war ended US started withdrawing and today there are just 200 US troops left in one air base. But if the terrirorry is again being center of geopolitical tension there is absolutely nothing preventing US from negotiating re-opening of many of its bases and sending more military. Meanwhile Denmark contributes with some (mostly naval) presence and generally keeps the Greenland population firmly on the ""right side"" by very heavy subsidies to the Greenland population. Should US choose to send troops back and re open bases, a place to start could be the abandoned Camp Century where they earlier had a project involving nuclear defence. Upon its abandonment by the US army only the reaction chamber of the nuclear generator was taken while a large amount of biological and radioactive waste was left as it was hoped time would encapsulate it by snow and ice. However, with global warming the waste is now re surfacing and it is a great idea to have US back to clean this up before it pollutes the very fragile arctic ecosystems. Hope this clean up is part of the calculations.', 'At the very least it would cost century old allies.  The USA has one operational base on Greenland since 1943.  If Greenland was actually a Strategic location the USA could probably negotiate to build another though doubtful with Trump spinning the world against the USA.

You might have a personal bias/opinion based on the new “for you” algorithm (which is open sourced and fully transparent), but the fact that Elon managed to fire thousands of people and the app basically still runs the exact same (with a few nice upgrades like long form tweets and spaces) is still seen as a massive accomplishment in the business world. \n\nPlenty of CEOs don’t like Musk, but most still give him props for that one.

Advertisers fleeing has nothing to do with your user experience, people seem to forget there was already a ridiculous amount of bots and I’m not actually sure what most engineers would even know about tech debt - but again that has nothing to do with the user experience.\n\nThere’s two different arguments here. Are we saying he’s tanking the company, or tanking the product? Platform runs basically the same as it used too and the company was months from bankruptcy when he bought it… so once again, you can say you don’t care for the “for you” page personally, but to say he ruined the product or company just isn’t accurate. \n\nBut then again, it’s Elon, so loads of people will just crap on what he’s doing no matter what.', 'Oh yes I’m very aware haha.

That’s user experience too - just not the kind you notice right away.\n\nOn the tech side: when engineers talk about tech debt, it’s not exaggeration - it’s a warning sign. The platform might look stable, but under the hood it’s getting harder to maintain safely, especially when the team keeping it alive was cut in half.\n\nAs for Elon - I don’t think it’s about hating the guy. It’s more about recognizing the consequences of certain decisions - both for the product and the company. And honestly, they’re not as separate as they seem.\n\nAnd when you think about it… we’re not just talking about a social media platform anymore, are we?"", 'I just think advertisers are sort of irrelevant to this conversation, they support the idea that people don’t like Elon and X but having them or not having them really has nothing to do with the product. I also remember there being loads of bots prior to the purchase, it just hasn’t gotten much better like Elon promised it would. \n\nThe verification issue is a fair point to make 100%. This would also be a criticism I have. \n\nI think the debt thing is sort of irrelevant too, only because there was roughly six months before bankruptcy when he purchased. So if he didn’t purchase it, it either would have gone under or amassed loads of debt anyway. Things under the hood were already in a terrible state, it’s not at all similar to say, Facebook purchasing instagram, where it was running pretty solidly already. Elon was super vocal immediately about this, and mass layoffs for a company in that state probably should have been expected.', ""Totally fair, if we’re already this forgiving when it comes to how he ran a private company into chaos “with good reason,” just imagine how that same logic plays out now that he's already influencing federal policy, rolling out tariffs, threatening to gut regulatory agencies, and floating mass layoffs “to streamline” government.  \nExcept this time, it’s not a product you can shut down - and it’s not a company you can drive into bankruptcy and walk away."", '>They support the idea that people don’t like Elon\n\nElon simps really wish that was the case.  I mean you really have to bury your head in the sand to believe that since they’ve told people why.  \n\n>After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022, he cut moderation teams and reversed bans on controversial figures, leading to fears that hate speech, misinformation, and extremist content would rise.\n\n>Major brands, including Apple, Disney, IBM, and Coca-Cola, paused or pulled their advertising to avoid appearing alongside offensive or unsafe content.\n\n>“We are concerned about our ads appearing next to content that does not align with our values.” — IBM statement, Nov 2023\n\n>Musk’s endorsement of conspiracy theories and controversial statements alienated many advertisers.\n\n>In November 2023, he publicly agreed with an antisemitic tweet, prompting an immediate pullback by major advertisers.\n\n>Disney, Apple, IBM, Lionsgate, and others suspended advertising after that incident, according to multiple reports including The New York Times and Axios.\n\n>Frequent, abrupt changes to features, algorithms, and verification systems created uncertainty about the platform’s direction and reliability.\n\n>Brands saw reduced ROI and ad performance metrics, with fewer controls over where and how ads appeared.\n\nStudies from watchdog groups like Media Matters for America and the Center for Countering Digital Hate reported a significant increase in hate speech and misinformation after Musk’s takeover.\n\n>Some advertisers also faced real-time examples of their ads shown next to harmful content, which were used as case studies in media and advocacy campaigns.', 'I wouldn’t really say it’s forgiving… he did what he had to do to keep the business alive and out of bankruptcy and people got mad about the fact that that included mass layoffs. \n\nNow the conversation is turning political, but it’s not him rolling out tariffs despite how many people claim it is. He’s definitely all for mass layoffs - but not very long ago both sides could agree that that was needed in the federal government and that it was super inefficient. Now because Elon and Trump are the ones doing it, people are mad. This seems like a great example of something that if Biden did it with better optics people would have cheered, but because it’s the other side doing it people are mad.', 'Just two quick points here. \n\n1. Elon has made his stance on freedom of speech very clear. He doesn’t believe in policing speech beyond what the law requires. If you believe in free speech, this is something you should be happy about - whether you agree with what people holding opposite opinions than yourself are saying or not. Even if someone’s being mean, or outright lying/crazy about something. We can argue about whether this is good or bad from a business standpoint, but as an American, it should be seen as a good thing. \n\n2. Just regarding the studies you mentioned. You can find “official studies” that support literally any side of any argument. I’m not dismissing what you’re saying, simply pointing that out. I’m sure hate speech has risen, considering his stance on freedom of speech and what I mentioned in my first point. That’s really not a surprise. Elons response would be that the views/engagement on hate speech are down, despite broader numbers potentially being higher, but I don’t know nearly enough about that intricate data to argue that point personally.', '>He did what he had to do\n\nDid he though?', 'You do realize everything he’s done has been reported and documented.  It’s clear you’re being intentionally bias.  \n\nYou talk about freedom of speech from Musk who has been known to silence those on his platform he doesn’t like.  There are many cases, and you either choose to ignore them or you’re just spreading misinformation.\n\n>Suspension of Jacqueline Sweet: In January 2025, Jacqueline Sweet, a reporter for The Spectator World, was suspended from X after she debunked a conspiracy theory alleging that Musk was using a burner account under the name Adrian Dittmann. Her suspension sparked criticism regarding press freedom on the platform.  \n\n>Suspension of Journalists Covering Musk: In December 2022, X suspended the accounts of several journalists from prominent outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN. These journalists had reported on Musk and the platform, leading to accusations that the suspensions were retaliatory.\n\nHate speech didn’t rise because of freedom of speech, Elon himself has engaged and encouraged it.\n\n>Endorsement of Antisemitic Conspiracy Theories: In November 2023, Musk replied to a tweet that accused Jewish communities of promoting hatred against white people, stating, “You have said the actual truth.” This endorsement was widely condemned as antisemitic by organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the White House. \n\n>Opposition to Prosecution of Far-Right Politicians: In 2024, Musk opposed the prosecution of European politicians known for using Nazi rhetoric, actions that were interpreted as supportive of far-right ideologies.\n\nYou’re arguing in defense of him while cherry-picking the information to undermine those that have legitimate criticism.  \n\nThat’s why you dismiss other CEOs not liking Musk.  You portray it like they don’t have any actual arguments and that they are bias.  It’s why you intentionally left out information about the reason advertisers left his platform.', 'I mean… the company was six months away from bankruptcy… so it would seem so, yeah. \n\nThe fact that so many people could be let go and it still operates fine on the face of things shows many of those people were clearly unnecessary. I’m not saying he maybe didn’t go overboard, and maybe should’ve kept a few hundred more people or something, but regardless it’s pretty clear that thousands of people working for Twitter were irrelevant to the company. \n\nRunning a business of that size is also something far far far above our pay grades. Unless you have experience running a multi thousand person social media/software/tech company, our opinions are kind of invalid. \n\nMost people trashing on Elon for X are similar to a fat 50 year old guy sitting at home yelling at and trying to remotely coach an NFL QB on the TV. It’s just ridiculous.', 'I’m not a news platform, I didn’t intentionally leave anything out - it’s not my job to report on everything going on. \n\nYou yourself cherry picked two examples of him silencing people he doesn’t like, but there was tens of thousands of these examples released that the old Twitter team was doing when he took over. Those will go ignored though. When Musk does it it’s horrible, when people who lean left do it at the old Twitter it’s completely fine.\n\nI’m not saying Musk is completely innocent, but you pointed out that he allowed conspiracy theorists and controversial figures back on the platform. So I responded to that regarding the freedom of speech stuff. He’s been very clear about that. Not to mention, a US president should not be banned off a social media platform. Quite frankly, neither should controversial people. Twitter allowed dictators who we knew murdered thousands of innocent people to stay on the platform, while kicking off people for saying things they didn’t like. \n\nI actually think the other CEOs simply don’t like Musk because he’s a ridiculously socially awkward dude. But I’m not going to pretend to speak for Zuckerberg or the others on that.', 'That’s not true.  Twitter was experiencing financial challenges but there is no indication that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy at that time. \n\nIn fact, Twitter’s financial situation became more precarious after Elon Musk’s acquisition. The $44 billion purchase in October 2022 added approximately $13 billion in debt to the company’s balance sheet, leading to significant annual interest payments.  \n\nAdditionally, the loss in advertising revenue hurt the company’s finances.  Twitter came closer to bankruptcy after Musk bought it.', 'When you say you’re not a news platform, what does that even mean?  I’m not a news platform either. It seems more like you’re just using it as an excuse to look the other way or simplify the facts of what is actually happening in order to create a biased defense of Musk, rather than approach it objectively.\n\nLike your example of why you think CEOs don’t like Musk.  You think they don’t like him because of him being awkward. But you can easily find statements if you actually wanted to without coming to a biased conclusion.  We’ve seen what the LinkedIn CEO said about Musk.  But your conclusion of it just being because he’s awkward is excusing his actual behavior and reasons for why they might not like him.']"

"Economic Frictions, Investment Flows and Trade Disputes",2025-04-02 21:56:53,"['**Political Aspects and Implications Excerpt**\n\n“Recent Semafor newsletters foreground significant geopolitical friction. The EU’s warning of a “strong” tariff response to potential US levies exemplifies the complexities of modern trade relations, which often transcend purely economic motivations to become tools of statecraft and political signaling (Baldwin, 1985). This dynamic echoes the concept of “weaponized interdependence,” where states leverage global networks for strategic advantage (Farrell & Newman, 2019). The potential EU counterstrike targeting Silicon Valley and American banks further illustrates this, indicating a willingness to escalate beyond traditional goods tariffs into strategic sectors.” More at:  [https://openaccessblogs.substack.com/p/economic-frictions-investment-flows](https://openaccessblogs.substack.com/p/economic-frictions-investment-flows) .

Beijing’s actions, framed partly as a response to perceived US “aggression” and support for Taiwan, underscore the security dilemma prevalent in the region, where defensive measures by one side are interpreted as offensive threats by the other (Jervis, 1978). The rhetoric used (“parasites”) signifies a hardening nationalist stance within China, impacting cross-strait relations and regional stability.\n\nChina’s diplomatic and economic push in Africa presents another facet of this competition, showcasing efforts to build influence and secure resources, often framed as an alternative to Western engagement (Alden & Wu, 2014). However, the analysis notes challenges, including conflicting interests with partners like Russia (whose actions are described as “sowing chaos”) and competition from other actors like Turkey in specific sectors (military drones), suggesting a complex, multi-polar environment rather than a simple bipolar contest.”\n\nMore in the Open Access Blog post: [https://doi.org/10.58079/13mje](https://doi.org/10.58079/13mje) \n\nSupport the Open Access Blogs:\xa0\xa0[https://ko-fi.com/theopenaccessblogs](https://ko-fi.com/theopenaccessblogs)\n\n\\[Written, Researched, and Edited by Pablo Markin.

The fear of US tariffs sparking stock market selloffs demonstrates the immediate impact of protectionist policies on market sentiment and economic stability (Irwin, 2017). The EU’s consideration of restrictions on US tech and finance signals the potential for broader economic decoupling in strategic sectors.\n\nChina’s economic strategy is multifaceted. Its increased R&D spending, bucking OECD trends, reflects a state-led drive towards innovation and technological self-sufficiency, aiming to shift its position in the global value chain (Naughton, 2021). This is directly linked to the push for homegrown high-end chip manufacturing, a critical bottleneck technology dominated by companies like ASML. The alleged poaching of Taiwanese engineers points to the intense, potentially illicit, competition in strategic industries.

Hyundai’s onshoring investment ($5 billion steel plant in Louisiana) contrasts with BP’s potential offshoring (selling Gulf stakes), illustrating diverging corporate strategies in response to supply chain risks, tariffs, and energy transition pressures. The Dollar Tree/Family Dollar divestment highlights challenges in retail consolidation and the pressures of inflation and costs.

The geopolitical tensions in East Asia and Africa are consistent with theories of realism and the struggle for power among states (Waltz, 1979). The rapid advancements in AI and the competition in the tech sector are central to discussions on the fourth industrial revolution and its societal consequences (Schwab, 2017).

Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.”  \n\nWith the barrage of chaos coming out of this White House, there really is just one goal for Trump. To put more money in his pockets and the pockets of his Billionaire friends.

It’s not as simple planting an apple tree and picking apples from it\n\n\nPlus wages aren’t dependent on the job you do. Well they are but a bigger factor is how valuable your skills are relative to other people. If you’re the only person in the world who can pick apples and no one else can, then you’ll get paid a lot of money. But if other people learn to pick apples, then the value of your apple-picking skills go down meaning your wages will go down as well\n\nBuying an apple is no different than buying labor (aka hiring employees), value is solely dependent on supply /demand.', 'Game has not changed.

Every period of time in history has been “different and unlike any time before it” but each time things have always reverted back to the mean (ask someone what they thought about the future of the economy in 2008 and no one would have predicted how good the 2010s would be). \n\nThere will always be good times and bad times.

Both have been wrong each time throughout history', 'This is not true at all, not even close. To simplify human labour into a commodity equivalent is woefully naive of human psychology, societal norms and government laws and regulations. Heard of minimum wage? Most developed countries have it in some form. Honestly is pretty impressive that you can try to simplify it down that far and still be that confident you are correct.\n\nHumans are extremely complex, and so are labour markets and wages/salaries. Supply and demand may affect the total number of jobs in a market, but certainly not ""everything to do with"" salary.', 'Labor IS a commodity. Outside of a few special edge cases like regulation on minimum wage or what you can or cannot hire someone for, anyone can freely buy and sell labor for whatever price. I can buy labor by paying someone to do a task or I can sell labor by doing a task for someone else. \n\nAnd the value of that labor is determined by the basic laws of supply and demand. If there are millions of people who can flip burgers, wage are going to be super low. If there is only a handful of people who can design and build something like ChatGPT, they’re going to be paid handsomely well because their skills are rare (for example, openAI engineers can make $800k+/yr in non-executive roles)\n\nSoftware developers used to make a ton of money in the last decade. However that’s literally changing today and salaries are trending downwards because in part due to a huge influx of new software developers drawn by the high salaries in the past few years. I personally know software developers who used to make $300k-$400k that are now making “only” $200k. It’s still a lot of money because software development is hard, but it’s less money than before nonetheless\n\nIt’s the same basic principle as buying any good or service\n\nNow whether labor SHOULD be treated as a commodity is a different argument but the reality is that it IS treated as one']"

Overconsumption is a huge problem. But that point is separate from the point that tariffs will raise prices for no reason. On goods that people actually do need to buy as well.', 'This is exactly what the wealthy elite want the working class to believe: that they don’t “need” certain goods, that they should accept a lower standard of living while billionaires continue to accumulate obscene wealth. The issue is not consumption—it’s the unjust distribution of wealth.\n\nThroughout history, the ruling class has used this narrative to pacify the masses. During the late 18th century, as France’s aristocracy indulged in extravagance, the common people were told to endure hardship. “Let them eat cake,” whether apocryphal or not, symbolizes the elite’s indifference to the struggles of the working class. It wasn’t just about food; it was about the fundamental injustice of a system where the few lived in opulence while the many suffered.\n\nWe see the same pattern today. The ultra-rich—who have built their fortunes on the backs of underpaid workers—preach austerity to the poor while spending millions on yachts, private jets, and mansions. They raise prices not out of necessity but because they can. Inflation, supply chain issues, and now tariffs are just convenient excuses to extract even more wealth from the working class.\n\nAnd now, thanks to these tariffs, workers will lose even more of their purchasing power—not to fund public services, not to improve infrastructure, but to allow billionaires to enjoy even lower taxes. Meanwhile, the very people who suffer the most applaud these policies, convinced that this is the natural order of things. It’s tragic!\n\nThe idea that people should simply “stop buying useless things” shifts the blame onto consumers rather than addressing the real problem: the economic system is designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the rest. Instead of asking whether we need certain products, we should be asking why, in a world of abundance, so many struggle to afford basic necessities while a tiny elite hoards unimaginable wealth.\n\nThe French Revolution erupted when people realized that their suffering was not a natural condition but a result of an exploitative system. Today, history is repeating itself—only the tools of control have changed. Instead of aristocrats in gilded palaces, we have billionaires in corporate boardrooms. Instead of swords and muskets, we have economic policies and propaganda. But the core injustice remains the same: a few take everything, while the many are told to be grateful for the scraps.', 'How convienent, lol.', 'Agree to this! I refuse to pay for prime and will only buy from amazon if I absolutely can not get things elsewhere. Hence things sitting in my cart unpurchased', ""I don't think anything on that list went down. Sure, prices always change, but over night, twelve of the 14 items in my cart had a significant prices increase while trump is on TV talking about putting tariffs on every country."", 'That was due to Biden inflation caused by all the free money he gave out.', 'Nailed it. Preach.', 'I hear you but we will never live in a utopian society and you can’t change human nature.  You want a revolution? Good luck, families will die and new people in power will do the same shit. I’m a modern day peasant. But I don’t need half the shit I buy to improve my standard of living.   My standard of living is not lower because I chose to consume less.  Unfortunately the American dream has turned to being able to buy everything for less.', 'The rich absolutely do want you to overconsume. But they just want you to spend on things that do not appreciate in value: consumables, most consumer goods, ideally indefinite subscriptions. Their wealth is built on your spending.\n\nThe only reason they ""let"" people buy their houses and have 401ks is because it helps inflate those prices AND create working class/small business voters (95+%) who think their interests are aligned with the ultra wealthy. It is just enough to pacify the population without representing a threat to their wealth accumulation.', 'Yeah, and it doesn’t stop there though. We’re gonna get nailed on everything not just things that we we buy, but we’re gonna go to the supermarket and food is gonna go up in price. Everything’s gonna go up in price any services you want or need gonna go up in price Internet bills gonna go up price heat electricity water. Everything except our average labor rate. That won’t go up in price and even if it does, it’ll be a very minuscule relative to the increase in cost of living.', 'You must mean a missal scientist. Trump was president when the first 2 trillion went out in the Cares act. The problem is he ignored every other warning about supply chain problems and left Biden the worst economy in 50 years.', 'I hear you, and I’m not calling for a revolution—history just shows that when economic injustice reaches a breaking point, revolutions happen, whether people want them or not. My point isn’t that we should burn everything down, but that the patterns of wealth accumulation and economic disparity we see today have led to major upheavals time and time again.\n\nThe French Revolution is just one example. Look at the Russian Revolution in 1917—decades of economic suffering, wealth hoarded by the elite, and a government that ignored the needs of the people led to an inevitable collapse. The same thing happened in China in 1949 and in Iran in 1979. Even the Great Depression in the U.S. didn’t lead to a full-scale revolution, but it forced massive economic reforms because people simply couldn’t survive under the existing system.\n\nIt’s not about utopia—nobody expects a perfect society. Human nature may not change, but systems do. And when the system is designed to keep the majority struggling while a tiny elite prospers, history shows us that people will eventually push back. Sometimes that leads to reform, sometimes to revolution, but it never stays the same.\n\nI respect that you’ve chosen to consume less, and that’s great if it works for you. But many people today aren’t cutting back by choice—they’re forced to, because their wages don’t keep up with the cost of living. And tariffs, inflation, and corporate greed keep making it worse. The “American Dream” was supposed to be about prosperity through hard work, not just about buying cheap goods. But when the economy is structured so that real wages stagnate while billionaires get richer, it’s fair to question whether the system is working for the people or against them.', 'Unfortunately we are dealing with instant gratification and delayed ramifications in the form of credit cards, credit lines, and buy now pay later.']"

Trump aides draft tariff plans that experts say could hurt the economy,2025-04-01 20:21:31,"['White House aides have drafted a proposal to impose tariffs of around 20 percent on most imports to the United States, three people familiar with the matter said, as President Donald Trump pushes for the most aggressive overhaul of the global economic system in decades.\n\nIf implemented, the plan is likely to send shock waves through the stock market and global economy. Assuming that permanent tariffs took effect in the current quarter and triggered robust retaliation by U.S. trading partners, the economy would almost immediately tumble into a recession that would last for more than a year, sending the jobless rate above 7 percent, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s, who described the results as a worst-case scenario.\n\nWhite House advisers cautioned that several options are on the table and no final decision has been made. On Monday evening, Trump repeatedly suggested the tariffs would be “reciprocal” — in direct proportion to those levied by foreign countries on U.S. exports — and indicated that many countries would not be included in the import duties. That would probably represent a less drastic action than a single universal tariff.\n\nThe administration has for weeks been involved in extensive planning to announce new tariffs on Wednesday, which the president has dubbed “Liberation Day.” White House officials have scoffed at economists’ warnings, arguing similar downbeat forecasts proved wrong when Trump imposed more modest tariffs during his first term. Administration officials insist the tariffs are needed to rebalance a global trading system that has discriminated against the U.S. for decades, making a hollow shell out of factory communities across the nation.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/01/trump-tariffs-draft-recession-projection/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/01/trump-tariffs-draft-recession-projection/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)', '>> could hurt the economy']"

US is simply too unstable, and personally I see this continuing for a long time in to the future unless there\'s very dramatic sweeping legislative changes. \n\nJust as an example, I am from Finland and we recently joined NATO. Previously we were not allied, we have kept our defence forces in good shape and the policy was to be ""good neighbours"" with Russia so that we would avoid conflicts. I read from the news that in the defence forces they had finalized the wartime planning for what the role of US would be in helping us in case of Russian agression. I\'m guessing it was mainly airpower and intelligence. Now (because of Trump) all of that has been thrown to the trash and the new projects are to plan for 1) defending without US help just like the plans were before and 2) defending in a situation where US is actively sabotaging our efforts / helping Russia.\n\nHow could we do anything long-term with a partner that can flipflop from being an ally to a possible aggressor within a couple of months? We for sure cannot buy military equipment from the US anymore and I cannot see how anyone could invest into US or plan for projects involving US investments into Finland. Diplomatically it doesn\'t make sense to show support to US initiatives because the next month US will hate for us for supporting ""the previous administration"". Anything that creates a years long dependency / relationship with US is a problem from now on. \n\nI think Trump\'s plan was to scare Europe into spending more on our defence, and in principle I agree with him. Countries like Germany have been slacking and that is part of the reason why we even have a problem with aggressive Russia. But he didn\'t just scare us, he has made us realize that we cannot depend on US in anything. This is very similar to our relations with China, they started investing heavily to European companies, infrastructure etc. and that stopped when people realized that with those investments come Chinese influence and we don\'t want too much of that.\n\nOf course I am sad about this since I have been pretty pro-american before.

The money was given to businesses in the US and around the world to boost the economy.   This money was wasted by businesses and it did not result in hiring at the low end.   So the trickle down affect was minimal.   \n\nTrump Agenda:  We don't give money to businesses, but deregulate, give local companies a platform to compete through Tariffs.   Global competition is good because it advances technology faster, and therefore creates more jobs.   Not really trickle down economics. \n\n  \nI could say the government got involved in a lot of things related to Wireless communication in WWII through the 1960s, and NASA projects that have trickled down into society to give us advancements.

Remember in high school history class, when discussing the industrial growth in the late 1800s and early 1900s?  Yeah, well before these monitoring agencies existed?  The laissez-faire approach compromises financial stability and environmental purity, paving the way for future crises (and we’ve had thousands of them because of no oversight before these agencies existed), even though firms may like the decreased red tape.\n\nI can keep going, if you’d like\n\nDefinitely not the time to break out Coca Cola and popcorn.  The bitcoin scam he’s running needs to be investigated for the money laundering scam and backdoor money racket it is', 'This is exactly why tariffs won\'t bring business/manufacturing back to the US.\n\nIt takes years to build manufacturing here, depending on the business, longer than 4 years. Plus, we can\'t make everything internally, so parts will still get hit with tariffs. Not to mention the millions in cost. Plus the next administration may get rid of the tariffs (or in Drumpf\'s case, next week the tariffs may end) so all of that money spent on building a plant here, is now wasted on a product that won\'t be cheaper than what can be imported. All a business has to do is find other trading partners for 4 years and wait for the next administration. And they may end up with better business deals so that they never pivot back to trading with the US.\n\nMeanwhile, internal businesses will increase their prices to be ""just under"" tariff prices, so everything gets more expensive. And their quality can go down considerably since they don\'t have to have a better product to be competitive.\n\nWith the more expensive prices, people start hoarding their money since they can no longer count on SSI or Medicare to help see them through. People start buying less because they might need medicine or groceries instead of whatever new shiny product is just coming out. Businesses start increasing prices more to offset the lack of sales.\n\nAnd since none of these will force businesses to pay their workers a living wage, all of the money coming in will go straight up the chain to the oligarchs while American\'s get poorer.\n\nAnd I\'ll believe the ""no tax under 150K"" when I see it.

It puts equilibrium on the inflation rate Vs wages.\n\nThat's why this administration appears to not know what they're doing because it's a tough idea to sell politically as a plan. It's kind of like what the Reagan administration did in the early '80s. However, instead of Volcker's strategy of aggressively raising the interest rates to make everything more expensive to ease spending with the caveat that it could trigger a recession. \n\nThey are in essence raising the cost of everything by increasing taxes through tariff.

If I wanted to steel man the argument, it would be something like if you place tariffs on goods (pause to tell you that Biden continued many of the tariffs Trump used in his first term) it will make American goods more price competitive in the medium to long term.

I have always had a solid blue belief system but for just about 20 years through the 70\'s and 80\' s I lived in a solid red, rural area where everyone I knew was struggling to stay afloat. I had married a guy from there whom I\'d met in college. He made minimum wage working for his father in their auto repair shop. I worked minimum wage in several jobs: chain grocery, mom&pop grocery, dental office, hotel night auditor, slaughterhouse. We worked together nights for a large photo lab. For a couple of years we ""owned"" a rural newspaper route...2 am to 7 am, 1000 miles and 6 days/week... before going to our day jobs. He eventually took a job building grain elevators, which meant being away weeks at a time. I decided to go to grad school in another part of the state, found employment there and never returned. \n\nMy point is that this was how all our friends lived.  Almost no one had a solid, local, good paying job with benefits. There were constantly layoffs and cut hours. Folks that had better jobs had to commute a long way with hellish winters. We owned a fixer upper house and didn\'t have (couldn\'t afford) kids. My friends with kids had it harder obviously. None of our marriages survived this. \n\nAll of this was before the Great Walmartization....so now the economic picture is worse and my friends don\'t really see it. They see billionaire/rich folks as being a good thing for the country. They see them as being incredibly intelligent, admirable, and innovative.... that we need them in order to move forward. My right leaning, maga friends believe that their struggles with lack of good jobs and difficult rural economic situations is completely the fault of Dems, taxes, and taxpayer money being wasted by Dems. I\'ve had friends shrieking at me about how immigrants are given taxpayer money to live in the lap of luxury in the city.The anger about student loan forgiveness was/is stupendous. I think it\'s possible that Harris lost entirely on these issues.\n\nSo in conclusion, the magas I know really don\'t care if billionaire tax cuts help them in any way. They\'re fine with it. They are used to struggling, they blame Dems. They are definitely racist and misogynistic. They hate city people and educated people. They hate taxes and rules (smoking , seat belts, motorcycle helmets, building codes/permits etc) passionately...all the fault of Dems. And yes, they believe the stuff they see on Facebook and hear on Fox.\n\nWhen I have presented them with evidence that Dems. have actually helped them more than Repubs, I have been told that they have to vote Republican because that\'s how they were raised; it\'s a family tradition for generations that must be continued.

Tax cuts for billionaires were not even on their radar. Of course, his supporters should have been clued in when Elon Musk took the stage at Trump rallies, but I digress. \n\nI remember watching someone at a Trump rally trying to explain tariffs to a Trump supporter, how the American people will pay for the tariffs, and the Trump supporter said, No, foreign countries will pay. After a few minutes of telling him how tariffs work, you could see the lightbulb moment. We need more people talking to each other, not less. \n\nI’m not saying Trump supporters are all uneducated.

He will ship the money (from the tax cut) out of this country and build his factories or something else in another country that has cheaper labor and looser environmental regulations. The headquarter is still in the US because his customers are still (mainly) in this country. The problem stamps from the difference between the labor cost and regulation requirements of advanced nations and third world countries. So, no matter how much money the billionaire saves, the result will be the same. Even worse, as third world countries are advancing, their demand for consumer goods will also rise, so the billionaire, like Elon Musk, will have perfect incentive to ship his money out of the US to countries like China, and in the future Vietnam.', ""My theory has always been that many Americans imagine themselves as being rich one day so they go along with these trickle down proposals that gut Medicaid and SNAP today.

The libertarian theory is that by giving billionaires more money, that will make them invest more and hire more people. This is completely false. The main reason for that, these taxes are on personal incomes. And companies make investments and hire people, not billionaires. Personal incomes of billionaires go in offshore banks, for imported luxury and luxury estates. They bring minimal benefits to economy, as import of finished products is minus for the GDP, and basic needs of billionaires are the same as every other human. So they spend for local goods as much or slightly more than average. As for luxury estates - you can see that in Puerto Rico. These investments rise the prices of real estate, so that is negative for the other buyers, but the overall benefits for local economy are minimal. This is the reality.\n\nAbout the idea that taxes on incomes of billionaires will bring a lot money, this is also false. Such taxes are matter of fair taxation, not of fixing deficits. Take Musk - his shares are evaluated of hundreds of billions USD. And obviously if he start to sell, the price will fall.

Here's a deeper dive into the possible financial impacts:\n\n1. **NATO Contributions**: \n   - Currently, the U.S. covers about 22% of NATO’s $3 billion budget, equating to approximately $660 million to $700 million annually.\n   - EU countries would collectively need to increase their defense budgets to cover this gap. This increase would amount to $30 billion to $50 billion annually when accounting for not only funding NATO but also enhancing their own defense capabilities to meet the strategic shortfall left by a reduced U.S. presence.\n\n2. **Defense and Military Spending**:\n   - A more robust EU military capability might require additional spending of $20 billion to $30 billion annually, or possibly more, to cover infrastructure, personnel, technology, and strategic deterrence enhancements.\n\n3. **Security Infrastructure and Operations**:\n   - Investment in satellite surveillance, advanced cyber defenses, and intelligence operations could add several billion dollars annually. This could mean a combined additional expenditure of $5 billion to $10 billion to establish independent capabilities.\n\n4. **Economic Impact on Local Economies**:\n   - The removal of U.S. military bases and personnel could lead to economic decline in regions dependent on the bases for local employment and business. This loss of local and regional economic activity might indirectly affect national economies, needing potentially another $1 billion to $3 billion annually in government support to affected areas.\n   \n5. **Foreign Aid and Strategic Programs**:\n   - U.S. foreign aid to Europe would need to be compensated, although these figures are smaller, suggesting an additional budgetary commitment of around $1 billion annually for various programs.\n\n6. **Impact on Social Services**:\n   - EU countries, collectively, could face a reallocation challenge. Europe's social welfare system is vastly different due to strong commitments to healthcare and social services, funded primarily by taxation.\n   - Covering the financial gap left by the U.S. might require increased taxation or budget cuts elsewhere. While many EU nations could potentially absorb these increased costs in the short term, maintaining long-term commitments to free healthcare and extensive social services without increasing taxes might become challenging.\n   - Governments might need to prioritize or reevaluate their spending to ensure they can sustain these services without U.S. assistance. This could lead to debates about raising taxes or restructuring certain social benefits.\n\nIn summary, while the EU could manage the immediate financial burden of increased defense spending, sustaining long-term social services at current levels might become more problematic without additional revenue or restructured fiscal policies. The economic resilience of Europe would depend largely on countries' willingness to collaborate closely and possibly integrate further to share these financial burdens effectively.\n\n\n\nLike I said, EU wouldn't have all those pretty things without the United States and its people FUNDING it out of our own pockets.  EU wouldn't survive.  Your tax dollars would need to be reallocate to defense spending, not all those nice shiny welfare and social programs they love to throw in our face.

While specific decisions would depend on political priorities and economic conditions, here are some potential areas for cuts or adjustments:\n\n1. **Public Services**: \n   - Reductions in funding for public services such as healthcare, education, or transportation could be considered. This might involve fewer resources for hospitals, schools, or public transport projects.\n\n2. **Social Programs**: \n   - Adjustments to social welfare programs could be made. This might include changing eligibility criteria for benefits, reducing benefit amounts, or scaling back on certain initiatives, such as unemployment benefits or housing support.\n\n3. **Infrastructure Projects**: \n   - Delaying or scaling down infrastructure projects could free up funds. This might include road construction, public transit expansions, or other major public works.\n\n4. **Cultural and Recreational Programs**: \n   - Reductions in funding for cultural institutions, arts programs, and recreational facilities could also be a possibility. This would affect grants for cultural initiatives and local community programs.\n\n5. **Administrative Expenses**: \n   - Streamlining government operations and reducing administrative overhead could be another area for potential savings. This may involve reorganizing government agencies or cutting non-essential administrative costs.\n\n6. **Investment in Innovation or Development**: \n   - Some funding for innovation, research, or development could be delayed or reduced, impacting areas such as technology grants or research funding.\n\nUltimately, any decision would reflect the government's policy priorities, and such significant cuts in public spending could face political challenges and public scrutiny. Discussions about reallocating funds typically involve debates about the balance between national defense and other societal needs.***\n\n\nWould you look at that!

I’m from CA and for once we’re not the most expensive ✊🏼', 'There aren’t any beer distributors that aren’t super wealthy in Wyoming. Look at the Spicer Family in southwest Wyoming.', 'Grok says…..The cost per case of beer in Wyoming is higher than in most other states due to a combination of factors related to geography, population, distribution challenges, and taxation. Wyoming consistently ranks among the most expensive states for beer, with an average price for a 24-pack of domestic beer (like Bud Light or Miller Lite) around $26.68 to $28.78, based on various studies from 2019 to 2024, compared to the national range of $16 to $33.\nOne key reason is Wyoming’s large size and sparse population. With only about 580,000 residents spread across nearly 98,000 square miles, the state has a low population density. This makes distribution more costly, as beer must be transported over long distances to reach fewer customers, driving up logistics expenses. Fewer retailers and less competition can also allow sellers to charge higher prices, as there’s less pressure to keep costs low compared to more populous states.\nAnother factor is economies of scale. In states like Illinois or New York, where population centers are larger and more concentrated, brewers and distributors can sell higher volumes at lower margins. In Wyoming, the smaller market means higher per-unit costs to cover overhead. Remote locations, like Alaska and Hawaii, face similar issues, but Wyoming’s landlocked position and rugged terrain add to transportation challenges without the extreme isolation of those states.\nTaxation plays a role, though it’s less significant in Wyoming than in some high-cost states. Wyoming’s beer excise tax is among the lowest in the U.S. at $0.02 per gallon, translating to roughly $0.045 per 24-pack (2.25 gallons). Compare this to Tennessee ($1.29 per gallon) or Alaska ($1.07 per gallon), where taxes significantly inflate prices. However, even with low excise taxes, Wyoming’s base price before tax is high, suggesting distribution and market dynamics are bigger drivers. Federal excise taxes (ranging from $0.11 to $0.58 per gallon) and potential local fees apply uniformly nationwide, so they don’t explain Wyoming’s outlier status.\nHistorical data supports this trend. In 2019, Wyoming’s average was $26.68, second only to Alaska ($31.21), while cheaper states like Illinois averaged $15.20. By 2024, Wyoming’s price rose to $28.78, still trailing Alaska ($33.62) but far above Illinois ($16.43). Inflation has increased costs everywhere, but Wyoming’s remain elevated due to its structural challenges rather than policy alone.\nIn short, Wyoming’s high beer prices stem primarily from its vast geography, low population, and resulting distribution inefficiencies, compounded by limited competition and scale, rather than excessive taxation.', 'Now do Mexico and Argentina.

But the admin is trying to juice the economy because they just pulled a huge amount of government spending."", 'In America I think it started when we bailed out big banks in 2008 and let Americans fall to the bottom. Banks were being reckless with money and overburdened the market, then cried to the government that they can’t go bankrupt otherwise it’ll be really bad for everyone. So the government obliged, bailing them out to prevent a banking collapse which shifted the collapse onto civilians instead while banks get to keep the status quo. This was the first significant transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich. Then Covid happened in 2020, which was another transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich, who gained as much wealth as was approximately lost by everyday Americans. and now id argue that a 2nd Trump presidency is another wealth transfer due to changes in tax code for 2026, when he already created a 7 year tax code in 2018 that shifted the burden from high income earners to lower earners. \nThe 2026 tax code will do similar, absolving billionaires and corporations of their tax burdens, which requires that to be shouldered by the reset of us, further squeezing more wealth. On top of this we have rising costs due to inflation and emergency circumstances, that just never came back down. Companies love any excuse to claim that “cost of business has gone up” to raise prices on groceries and never bring them back down later. But they never seem to consider that paying a grocery CEO $50 million dollar salary packages or bonuses is an unnecessary “cost of business” that we subsidize as customers. \nSo the precedent has been set that our government will bail out and stand up for corporations and CEOs, while allowing that burden to fall onto us, and telling us “just work harder it’ll be OK!, look, you can be like us one day we are actually doing really good!! So the economy is fine we swear because our numbers are green, you’re just doing something wrong”. There’s this systemic gaslighting built into our socioeconomic politics. So I think the root of America’s problems is the trickle upwards of all wealth. \n\n\nTo put it into perspective, \n1% of top American earners own 47% of national wealth. While the bottom 50% of all American earners, own only 2.5% of national wealth. There is nothing that has ever been done to systemically redesign or redistribute the popsicle structure we’ve built, and they just keep applying more pressure because it’s working for them. Americans are inundated with poor education, nuclear families which require your devoted attention, misinformation echo chambers, and gaslighting politicians (both parties) so we are effectively powerless against corporate efforts to lobby laws and taxes in their favor. \n\nFor example, in Washington state when you buy a used car, you pay sales tax on it a 2nd time even though the owner already did. And say you turn around to sell it a week later to your neighbor, they now have to pay that tax a 3rd time. This law exists because of dealership lobbies who were threatened by private sales being more attractive than dealership sales so they “evened the playing field” so to speak. How on earth does this help the working class people who try to buy an affordable car and get slapped with taxes that were historically already paid by our class. It’s double and triple and quadruple dipping in tax revenue on the exact same durable good. You could have a $30k car that has garnered $15k in taxes from 5 owners in 5 years as an extreme. All because dealerships wanted people to get less appealing deals on used cars. \n\nAnd sure, tax revenue is good for the roads, but that could be sourced from a corporate activity tax or a tax on dealerships, or a pollution tax or anything other than an additional tax to squeeze us regular folk. The entire system is built by corporations for corporations at the expense of human beings. I think that is why America struggles to have a real middle class anymore. None of this even addresses cost of living which is also a huge problem, very similar to Canada. All the new housing is developers trying to make a buck so when they add new homes in my rural country bumpkin area it’s all $700k+ luxury cookie cutter homes in a cul-de-sac.

Countries will always be better off focusing on their comparative advantage. This has been known for over 200 years dating back to David Ricardo. The United States does not have the population advantage to compete with the likes of China and India, so it makes sense that those nations can produce cheap goods easier. \n\nThe United States shifted away from being a manufacturing nation to focus on what we have always been good at, industries that require a high level of skill. Pharmaceutical, technological, and financial industries are what we should be focusing on. That is our competitive advantage.\n\nThis data is also not entirely transparent. If you go back to the 60s you can see more accurately what has happened to the middle class wealth % relative to the 1%’s wealth %. \n\nIn the 1980s Reganomics was the fiscal agenda in the United States of America. It gave large tax breaks to the American people and the top beneficiaries were the top 1%. This was a short term boom in the economy, but in the long term it has created the wealth gap that we see today. \n\nOf course no politician since then has thought to reverse course on tax policy because rising taxes back to their appropriate levels is not only an unpopular decision, but also will get the top 1% to lobby HEAVILY against you.\n\n-Econ major.', 'Totally ignoring the massive tax breaks that the rich got 👀', 'Tf does this have to do with globalization lmao', ""Business owners gain access to cheaper foreign labour.\n\nWorkers have to compete with cheaper foreign labour.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nMany of the goods we enjoy today are the fruits of cheap labour in less developed countries.\n\nThey would not be as cheap if produced domestically because it costs more to produce in developed countries (wages, for one).\n\nEDIT: I believe the idea was to offshore low skilled jobs to less developed countries, so that people in developed countries can focus on high skill/value jobs and amass even more wealth.\n\nUnfortunately, this has fallen short in 2 regards:\n\n1. People in developed countries do not necessarily pursue high skill jobs, and end up competing with less developed countries for low skill jobs. Basically rural folk, poor folk, dropouts, etc. They then lose out because of their cost disadvantage (e.g. a US factory worker's wages vs a Chinese factory worker's).\n\n2. Developing countries can eventually catch up to developed nations as they gain expertise, wealth and knowledge. We see this happening in China.

It's a layered issue, and you're right that society's spending and debt habits play a role. But taxation and wealth distribution are still key pieces of the puzzle. It's all interconnected, and addressing one without the other might not get us far.\n\nYou're absolutely right that societal spending and debt habits play a significant role in economic disparity. When consumer culture emphasizes living beyond one's means; fueled by easy credit, rampant advertising, and the pursuit of material goods; it creates a cycle of debt dependency. This can erode financial stability at the individual and societal levels.\n\nMeanwhile, large scale debt accumulation by governments contributes to systemic inequality. For example, prioritizing short-term spending over long-term investments in education, infrastructure, and equitable policies widens the wealth gap. Debt servicing (or paying interest) diverts resources away from addressing these critical needs, further entrenching class divisions.\n\nOn the flip side, taxation policies (or lack thereof) impact how wealth circulates. When the ultra-rich benefit from loopholes or lower effective tax rates, wealth concentrates at the top rather than flowing through the economy. Combine that with a society increasingly reliant on debt, and you get a recipe for widening inequality. It's all interconnected, which is why solving this issue requires a balanced approach targeting both individual and systemic behaviors.\n\nWhat do you think?

Help me understand the auto tariffs,2025-03-27 08:15:50,"['>  Is there any economic logic to this? \n\nNo.', 'Part of these tariffs are trump setting up leverage for things he\'s going to ask for later. For china, he\'d been increasing tariffs, but just recently he said he could make those tariffs go away if they agree to give trump what he wants on tik tok. Trumps been complaining about how the boundaries between canada and the US were drawn. for all we know, he could be layering on tariffs, then may say ""instead of surrendering completely and being annexed, why not just redraw these lines here to what I think they should be and all these tariffs will go away"". Not saying it\'s a good plan, but trump using pain to get leverage over/blackmail others is absolutely on brand for him. When it comes to negotiating with a carrot or a stick, most of the time, trump prefers to use the stick.\n\nThe other thing I think the tariffs accomplish is shifting the tax burden to the middle/lower class (while cutting taxes for higher income earners). Tariffs are regressive taxes, and the tax income will be used to offset the tax losses from lower taxes on higher income earners. I\'m not sure if this is true, but I don\'t believe you need the IRS as much if much of the nations tax revenues are shifted towards tariffs (import taxes). assuming that,  hollowing the IRS and shifting how the nation takes income in are aligned.  I\'m not saying any of this is a good idea, just stating how I feel about it.', ""The idea is to raise money with a tax that applies to people who spend money like a sales tax, and then give it as income tax breaks to people who don't spend all their income ($450k/yr+, permanent tax breaks over 10 years give $4.5T). This takes money from lower income people and gives it to rich people, and the richer they are the more they get. Making the tariff lets them project increased tax revenues as a percent of prior imports ten years into the future even though tariffs don't work that way. High tariffs prevent sales, stifle the global economy and reciprocal tariffs affect exports and hence reduce tax revenues as well, nor is keeping them permanent tenable. So they intend to lie about the tariff and other expected revenues just long enough to get the tax cut through and then just print money to add to the deficit to make things balance during the resulting financial crisis. The increased taxes and defunded government don't make half of their giveaway anyway, so they were always going to print the rest. Then there are side bets on the market side effects they know they're going to cause for pocket money.\n\nThe intent has nothing to do with jobs, American manufacturing or economy. That's the cover story. The truth is that the taxes will devastate the economy, the printing will bring back rampant inflation, and the crisis is manufactured deliberately. It's a robbery of the US Treasury by the rich."", 'I would like to address one point you make. If we assume as you do that cars will become more expensive, and this will be a burden for car buyers, are the jobs worth it?  While it remains to be seen how the balance falls, workers who are paid better put their wages right back into the economy in the form of consumer goods, real estate, services, etc.  This is arguably better than paying less money for a car manufactured abroad, but that money goes to corporate profit where a metaphorical dragon sits in it.', 'You pay more.', 'Lol 😆 👊🇺🇲🔥', ""Can't wait for this trickle down thing to start"", 'I totally see the raising money and it acting like a tax.

When they shipped all these car factories to Mexico car prices stayed the same and corporate profits made all these gains but they will never now accept less profit.\xa0\n\nThis is rhetorical, but even with the added benefit of the American jobs putting that money back into the economy, how many jobs would the tariff have to produce to justify cars being 25% more expensive for 340 million people..\xa0', ""It's in the budget and been well discussed, reported, lamented.\n\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/house-republican-budgets-45-trillion-tax-cut-doubles-down-on-costly"", 'Where have you looked?\xa0', ""That only applies if cars are still selling at the same volume. if sales drop profits drop so layoffs happen to maintain profit growth because... that's capitalism baby.""]"
